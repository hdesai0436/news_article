2,Why Did Retail Bitcoin Holders Seem to Buy More BTC Despite Crypto Winter?,Lee Clarke,2023-02-16 11:38:00,"Retail bitcoin holders, or individual investors, have shown strong resilience in accumulating more Bitcoin in the face of the recent crypto winter. Despite the bear market that has seen the price of bitcoin drop significantly, many retail investors have continued to or Credit cards. There are several reasons why retail investors seem to be showing optimism in the face of market uncertainty today. We have discussed these possible reasons in detail in this work. Crypto winter is a term used to describe a period of bearish market conditions in the cryptocurrency industry, this period is usually characterized by a sharp decline in the prices of digital assets and a reduction in trading volume. It is often seen as a time of market correction and consolidation after a previous period of rapid growth and hype. The term “crypto winter” was first used during the market downturn that occurred in late 2018, following the massive price increases and hype surrounding cryptocurrencies in late 2017 and early 2018. During this period, the prices of many popular cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, saw significant drops, and many smaller projects and companies in the industry struggled to survive. The decline in prices and investment activity led to a slowdown in innovation and development within the industry, and many people lost money as a result of the market correction. Retail Bitcoin holders are individuals who own and hold small amounts of the Bitcoin. These individuals typically purchase and store Bitcoins through online exchanges or wallet services for personal investment or payment purposes. Retail holders can come from a wide range of backgrounds and demographics and may use Bitcoin for a variety of reasons, including as a store of value, as a speculative investment, or for making transactions online. The recent crypto winter has not deterred non-whale bitcoin investors from buying more BTC. These retail investors have broken a new accumulation record, buying up more bitcoin than ever before. This phenomenon is a testament to the growing mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies and the increasing interest of retail investors in the asset class. One of the main drivers of this trend is the younger generation, who are tech-savvy and see cryptocurrencies as a valuable investment opportunity. Millennials and have grown up with technology and are comfortable with digital assets, which has led to a significant increase in retail investment in cryptocurrencies. Moreover, the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies and their ability to resist censorship has made them an attractive option for retail investors who are concerned about the security of their assets. In a world where central authorities can seize or freeze assets, cryptocurrencies offer a level of protection and independence that traditional investments do not. Additionally, the growing recognition of cryptocurrencies by mainstream corporations and financial institutions has helped to legitimize the asset class and make it more accessible to retail investors. Major companies such as Tesla and Square have invested in bitcoin, lending credibility to the asset class and making it more appealing to retail investors. In conclusion, the recent accumulation of bitcoin by non-whale retail investors could be regarded as a positive sign for the cryptocurrency market. This is because the continued interest of retail investors in the face of the crypto winter is a testament to the growing mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies and their potential as a valuable investment opportunity.",sports,2
3,Used Volvo S90 and V90 review buying guide,Renée Bourke,2023-02-16 10:00:00,"MOTORING BLOG I see more Volvo V90’s on the road than Range Rovers’, so is now a good time to buy into the 4×4? Maybe there is a reason why the Volvo estate has become such an icon: decades ago, while its rivals were focusing exclusively on saloons, this Swedish car maker was making far more practical family models. First released in 2016, the V90 got a range of petrol, diesel and hybrid units. The entry-level 187bhp 2.0-litre diesel, badged D4 and starting from £16,000 on the used market, can just about cope with the 1761kg minimum kerb weight of this large estate car. The 232bhp 2.0-litre diesel (D5) does so more competently, though. The same can be said for the capabilities of the 2.0-litre petrols, the 187bhp T4 and 247bhp T5. The 385bhp T8 often goes for upwards of £30,000 and could be considered a wolf in sheep’s clothing. It’s a petrol-electric plug-in hybrid that’s extremely quick to accelerate, as is evident in its 4.8sec 0-60mph time. The hybrid set-up also shuffles between power sources effortlessly. For 2020, Volvo brought in mild-hybrid technology featuring a 48V integrated starter-generator. These units begin with a ‘B’ to distinguish them from the regular ‘D’ and ‘T’ engines. For instance, there’s a 197bhp petrol called B4P, as well as a 197bhp diesel dubbed B4D. The most powerful engine with the mild-hybrid tech is the 300bhp B6P. All come with 2.0-litre petrol or diesel units. Trims have also been revised: for 2022, the range has become Core, Plus and Ultimate, although few of these cars had hit the used market at the time of writing. It’s always been the Audi A6, BMW 5 Series and Mercedes E-Class that have given Volvo’s executive cars the hardest time, and it’s easy to see why. All offer wide model ranges with some excellent engines, gearboxes, saloon and estate bodystyles, plus excellent build quality. While they used to be relatively spartan, things changed a long time ago and they’re all now comprehensively equipped, although all three are available with lots of extra-cost options.",sports,3
4,"Former Patriots foe Rex Ryan reportedly close to returning to the NFL, and New England’s schedule",Bernd Buchmasser,2023-02-16 10:00:00,"One of the New England Patriots ’ former foes appears to be nearing a return to the NFL. Per a report by NFL Network, Rex Ryan has “emerged as a top candidate” to become the next defensive coordinator of the Denver Broncos . Ryan, 60, rose to prominence as an assistant coach with the Baltimore Ravens in the early 2000s. The son of former NFL coach Buddy Ryan served as the team’s defensive coordinator between 2005 and 2008, playing a key role in establishing the Patriots-Ravens rivalry that would soon become one of the fiercest in all of football. In 2009, Ryan took over as New York Jets head coach — famously claiming early in his tenure that he “never came here to kiss Bill Belichick’s rings” and that he was “certainly not intimidated by New England or anybody else.” Ryan backed up his bravado by winning three of his first five games against the Patriots, including a playoff game in 2010. However, over the next four years Ryan’s Jets went 1-7 against the Belichick-led Patriots. He was eventually fired after the 2014 season, his fourth straight without a winning record. He left New York with a 50-52 record and two trips to the AFC Championship Game in his first two years at the job. Ryan joined the Buffalo Bills two weeks after leaving the Jets, but he failed to duplicate the success he had in New York. He was let go toward the end of his second season, having gone 8-8 and 7-8 until that point. Instead of returning to coaching, Ryan joined ESPN as an analyst — a job he has held ever since. Now, however, there is a chance he will return to the NFL and onto the Patriots schedule. The Broncos, who hired Sean Payton as their new head coach earlier this offseason, are set to visit New England during the 2023 regular season. There is a chance Rex Ryan is on their staff at that point.",sports,4
5,Upcoming Sports Games for PC,Sandy,2023-02-16 09:30:09,"PC gaming is seen by many to be the elite way to play, with it offering greater graphics, a larger variety of games, and the opportunity to use the keyboard and mouse for better control options. Despite these advantages, one genre of games that had always seemed better suited to its console rivals though, have been the sports titles. One of the major reasons for this has been the fact that more players are on the consoles’ online servers, leading to more opportunities for playing matches against human opponents online. Nevertheless, that’s all changing nowadays, as the PC format is being much more targeted by gaming developers who produce sporting games.

6,The advantages of online casinos over land-based casinos,Sandy,2023-02-16 09:20:57,"Nowadays, more and more people prefer to play gambling on the Internet. This includes even people of the older generation, who used to recharge their excitement only from the live game, the opportunity to sit at tables covered with green and red velvet, to get nervous of opponents and train in the art of bluffing. This is primarily due to the fact that getting into a land-based casino has become much more difficult. Most countries have a policy of strict control over the sphere of gambling and fight against addiction. Land-based casinos may be only in special areas. Most often these are resorts or popular tourist destinations. Somewhere, the casinos are completely banned. Not everyone can afford to go to another city or even halfway across the country to play at a casino. Even if the casino is in your city, you have to think about the dress code, spend time on the road. With online casinos all these unnecessary hassles fall away – you will always be welcome, no matter where in the world you are. Also, online casinos have a bigger budget – thousands of players play there every day, so the jackpot increases several times faster than in real casinos. Almost all online casinos give players free freespins, the opportunity to try out slot machines and slots in test mode, which cannot be boasted by real casinos. An undoubted advantage of online casinos is no need to keep cash or bank cards. The very process of exchanging money for chips in the casino, of course, can cause a pleasant sensation and the effect of presence, but these actions often take a long time. At online casinos you can instantly credit your account. Here you can make calculations using convenient payment systems and e-wallets. Nowadays, no business can do without modern gadgets. Online casinos are no exception. Mobile versions and applications for Android and iOS released all the leading virtual casinos. Mobile casino is a great opportunity to play anywhere and at any time on your smartphone or tablet. The advantages of mobile casinos are obvious for those who have to travel frequently or go on business trips. Slots can brighten up the long hours of travel. You can have time to play slots even on your way to or from work at home. Mobile casinos don’t need superfast internet or a huge amount of RAM to work effectively. Even if you are at home, you do not need to get up from the couch and turn on the computer to start the game. In order to play online casino on a smartphone or tablet, you need to consider some technical characteristics. Your device should have at least 512 MB of RAM (for the simplest graphical casino interface), and better from 1Gb. It is preferable to choose a device with an Android or iOS operating system. If you have a gadget with some rare operating system, you can always play through the browser by opening the mobile version of the online casino website. The competition in the online casino market is very high. In this case, any casino will be difficult to stand out due to the set of games, since the slot machines and slots are basically the same at all of them. Attract new players and keep regular customers help systems accrue bonuses. There are two main types of bonuses at online casinos – no deposit and deposit bonuses. No deposit bonuses are usually given to new players and encourage them to perform a certain action. Online casinos give players direct bonuses for registering for them, filling out their contact information, confirming their e-mail or cell phone number, and consenting to receiving their newsletters. In order to start playing the game without depositing any money into your account, no deposit bonuses are very attractive to players as they allow players to start playing without depositing any money. Deposit bonuses are aimed at stimulating the player to make a payment, that is, to make a deposit. Among them is the welcome bonus – a bonus credited to your first deposit. In order to encourage the player to make a deposit, apply different marketing strategies, for example, charging a certain number of free-spins, depending on the amount entered, crediting additional funds in the account, cashback, promotions and special offers for the game on a particular slot machine. Many well-known brands have already established themselves in the online casino market and have a solid share of loyal customers. Nevertheless, new online casinos are constantly appearing. Not everyone is willing to trust a newcomer to the online casino market, because even experienced players are afraid of fraud, phishing devices and just the uncertainty that accompanies the game at an unfamiliar site. However, everything is far from being so pessimistic, and often newcomers to the market, trying to distinguish themselves, create an innovative design, more user-friendly interface and attractive bonuses. How to determine whether to trust a new online casino? First of all, you should find information about the license of the given operator, study the information about jurisdiction and certification of slot machines. Companies, aiming to win their place on the market, will never conceal this or other legal information. Do not be afraid of the super-attractive promotions offered by new casinos. Most often, players are scared of such large-scale bonuses, because they are not used to such generosity from their usual online casinos. Casinos that have been in business for a long time already have a certain share of loyal customers and are not particularly eager to lure new players in large numbers. Players can come and go, the number of active players will be stable. However, new casinos need to try twice as hard to attract players, so they offer incredibly generous bonuses and promotions. On our website you can find reliable and verified new online casinos.",sports,6
7,"Brunson scores 28, Randle 25, Knicks rout Hawks",CBS New York,2023-02-16 04:27:13,"ATLANTA — Jalen Brunson is on quite a streak. The New York Knicks are confident it's no fluke. Brunson scored 28 points, Julius Randle added 25 and the Knicks cruised into their All-Star break with their third straight victory, blowing out the Atlanta Hawks 122-101 Wednesday night. New York moved six games above .500 (33-27) and is brimming with confidence about its prospects for the remainder of the regular season. ""There's still 22 games left,"" said RJ Barrett, who chipped in 17 points and was among six Knicks in double figures. ""We've got to stay the course."" The course looks promising the way Brunson is playing. In his first season with the Knicks after signing a $104 million deal in free agency, he is averaging 31.5 points over his last 10 games and 23.9 for the season. Hard to believe he was just a second-round pick by Dallas coming off a stellar college career at Villanova, where he won a pair of national titles. ""He's good and he knows he's good,"" Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau said. ""I don't think anyone is surprised by what he's doing."" But Brunson is hardly content. When told what his coach had said, the 26-year-old guard quickly pointed out he had five turnovers. ""Whenever I step on the court, I try to be the best player I can be,"" he said. ""There's always ways I can improve, no matter what's going on, whether I'm playing good or bad."" New York settled this one right from the start. The Knicks never trailed, building a 24-point lead in the first half and leading by double digits for the final 42 minutes of the game. The only sign of life from the Hawks came late in the third quarter, when they crept within 11. But Obi Toppin and Josh Hart connected on back-to-back 3s from the same corner early in the fourth to push the lead back to 19. That was it for the Hawks, who lost their second in a row to dip below .500 (29-30) in what has been a hugely disappointing season just two years after they reached the Eastern Conference final. Trae Young was held to 19 points on 4-of-14 shooting, making just one of six outside the 3-point stripe. De'Andre Hunter led the Hawks with 20 points. ""We definitely need a break,"" Young said. ""I've got faith in my team. I've got trust that we can make a special run."" Randle grabbed 11 rebounds for the Knicks, who finished with a 55-40 edge on the boards. Thibodeau fretted before the game about his team letting up heading into the All-Star hiatus. ""You don't want to go on break before the break,"" he said. Instead, it was the Hawks who sleepwalked through the contest, falling behind by double digits before the game was 5 minutes old. New York stretched the margin to 34-14 late in the first period, and the Hawks never got closer than 14 the rest of the opening half. The Knicks led by as many as 24 points and were up 66-44 at the break. Randle had 14 points over the first two quarters, while Brunson and Barrett chipped in with 12 apiece. Shredding Atlanta's defense, the Knicks knocked down 51% of their shots in the opening half, including 9 of 26 from beyond the 3-point stripe. The Hawks, on the other hand, connected on just 1 of 15 from long range before halftime. TIP-INS Knicks: New York improved to 8-6 since C Mitchell Robinson went down with a thumb injury. Jericho Sims has stepped up to fill Robinson's spot in the starting five, while Isaiah Hartenstein is providing solid minutes off the bench. ""When someone goes out, it's opportunity for someone else to step in,"" Thibodeau said. ""We're getting good production out of that position."" ,,, New York wrapped up its season series with the Hawks. Each team won twice. Hawks: Newcomer Saddiq Bey played his first game in front of the Atlanta fans after being acquired at the trade deadline. He had just 2 points in 18 1/2 minutes. ... The Hawks finished 5 of 26 on 3-pointers. ... John Collins left in the third quarter after taking an elbow the face. UP NEXT Knicks: Return from the All-Star break at Washington, where they will face the Wizards on Feb. 24. Hawks: Host the Cleveland Cavaliers on Feb. 24 in their first of four straight home games after the break.",sports,7
8,"Mikal Bridges scores career-high 45, Nets beat Heat",CBS New York,2023-02-16 04:20:09,"NEW YORK — In his third game since arriving in the Kevin Durant trade, Mikal Bridges had an electrifying scoring stretch to rival even the superstar he replaced. Bridges scored a career-high 45 points, including 15 in a row for Brooklyn to break open a game that had been close for 3 1/2 quarters, and the Nets beat the Miami Heat 116-105 on Wednesday night in the final game for both teams before the All-Star break. ""I just had it going and my teammates found me every time,"" Bridges said. The Nets led only 90-89 before Bridges went to work with an array of drives, 3-pointers and jumpers over the next three minutes. That pushed the lead to nine and when another Nets player finally scored, it was a 3-pointer by fellow former Phoenix player Cam Johnson that pushed it to 108-96. Bridges scored 17 points in the final quarter to blow by his previous career best of 34 points. He was 17 of 24 from the field, 4 of 6 on 3s and 7 of 7 at the line, and also had eight rebounds and five assists. ""I think overall just his spirit and energy and juice, even at our walkthrough today, like he had the mindset it seemed like he wasn't going to let us lose,"" Nets coach Jacque Vaughn said. Bridges was the runner-up for Defensive Player of the Year last season whose offensive game is growing. He said after the blockbuster trade last week that he understood why the Suns would trade him for Durant, and still does after averaging 25 points since while earning the nickname ""Brooklyn Bridges."" ""You traded a future Hall of Famer that averaged damn near 30 for his career, so I'm just trying to continue to get better and get to a point where I can score a little more,"" Bridges said. Cam Thomas added 19 points and Johnson had 18 for the Nets, who won for the first time since the two former Suns joined them in the lineup. Bam Adebayo had 24 points, 13 rebounds and six assists for the Heat. Max Strus scored 18 points. The Heat fell behind New York into seventh place in the Eastern Conference, out of guaranteed playoff position, and will hope missing regulars Tyler Herro, Kyle Lowry and Victor Oladipo get healthy during the break. ""We've got 23 to go to get to where we need to get to,"" Heat star Jimmy Butler said. ""It's all about being healthy, which is what going into this break is going to do for us, come out swinging for the fences in the right way."" Bridges scored on a jumper with 0.2 seconds left to give the Nets an 83-80 lead after three quarters in which neither team led by more than six points. Duncan Robinson had six points in his first game since Jan. 4 surgery to repair a finger ligament. TIP-INS Heat: Lowry missed his sixth straight game with left knee soreness. Oladipo has missed seven in a row with a sprained right ankle. ... Miami began a four-game road trip around the break. The Heat don't play at home again until March 1. Nets: Ben Simmons was booed when he checked in four minutes into the game. He finished with two points, four rebounds and four assists in 20 minutes. ... Seth Curry was scoreless in 10 minutes after missing five games with a left adductor strain. ... Brooklyn plays nine of its first 11 games after the All-Star break on the road. HURTING HERRO Herro missed his second straight game with a bruised left knee but is still scheduled to fly to Salt Lake City and compete in the 3-point contest at All-Star weekend. ""You're not burning any calories in that and you're certainly not colliding or jumping or doing anything,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""He is making progress. He definitely is not ready to be able to play in an NBA game tonight and then we'll just see how he feels the next two days with his treatment, whether he'll be able to do that. I know that he really wants to."" UP NEXT Heat: At Milwaukee on Feb. 24. Nets: At Chicago on Feb. 24.",sports,8
9,Why Harry Reid meant so much to Latter-day Saint Democrats like me,Steve Pierce,2023-02-16 04:00:00,"It’s been just over a year since Sen. Harry Reid’s death , but the legendary Senate leader’s impact continues to be felt even after he has left this mortal coil. Just a few weeks ago, he was the subject of a posthumous profile in The New York Times , with longtime loyalists, national pundits and even current Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (who succeeded Reid in the role) lauding the Nevada Democrat’s legacy — in his home state, in the nation’s capital, and in the political machinery of the party he led for so long. As one former staffer remarked in the piece, summing up the general sentiment, “you can see his fingerprints everywhere.” That observation — like the many others that have been made in the countless other profiles written since his passing — is undoubtedly true. Harry Reid really was all of those things in all of those venues. But, for me, he was also more than that. Because for all of the thousands upon thousands of words of well-deserved praise heaped upon Reid, the one aspect of his legacy that hasn’t been sufficiently memorialized is the one that just so happens to mean the most to me and others like me: the powerful example he set of what it looks like to be both a devout member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and a fiercely committed member of the Democratic Party. And while this portion of Reid’s inarguably consequential life and career may not be what gets him immortalized in history books, it lives in the hearts and minds of thousands of Latter-day Saint Democrats in just about every corner of this country. I haven’t always been a Democrat. Like many Latter-day Saints my age, I grew up in a household that reliably voted Republican (even if it wasn’t a particularly political one), attended church in an overwhelmingly conservative community, and came of age in that brief window of post-9/11 America where President George W. Bush was still viewed as a hero and highly popular wartime president trying to keep the country safe. So I suppose it shouldn’t be particularly surprising that an impressionable teenager without any real-world experience of his own emerged from that cauldron under the impression that he was a raging right-winger. However, my time as the 21st century reincarnation of Alex P. Keaton wasn’t long for this world. In fact, it lasted only as long as it took me to wander out of my upper-middle-class suburban community and witness the reality that so many Americans experience every day — as a Latter-day Saint missionary. When my mission call came, my assigned destination wasn’t some far-flung foreign locale. It was Florida — and one of the least glamorous parts of Florida: Tampa. But while the I-4 corridor may not have provided me with the opportunity to fully immerse myself in an exotic culture, my time there led to one of the most unexpectedly formative experiences of my life all the same — just not in the way I expected. During my time as a missionary, I had the opportunity to sit in countless living rooms and listen to humble, hardworking families from all walks of life pour out their hearts about the difficulties they faced, about fighting the seemingly endless uphill battle just to make ends meet, about working two or three jobs and still being worried about whether they could afford to pay the electric bill if they ran the ceiling fan in the middle of a muggy Florida summer. That didn’t sit right with me. It didn’t jive with the story I had been told (and told myself) about good old-fashioned Republicanism: that anyone could make it in America if they just pulled on their bootstraps — and that if you weren’t making it, you must not be pulling hard enough. But here were these amazing people who were working harder than anyone I’d ever met in my entire life and yet they still couldn’t make ends meet, despite living in the richest nation in the history of human civilization. What gives? These experiences sent me on a path of personal exploration, determined to find ideas and solutions that would help these people I had met for whom the version of the American dream that I’d been taught to believe in my entire life just didn’t seem to apply. That journey led me to the Democratic Party — and eventually, to one Harry Mason Reid Jr. Being a Democrat in the church can be a strange and uniquely challenging existence. After all, there haven’t been all that many of us in recent history — again and again , public opinion surveys find Latter-day Saints to be among the most steadfastly Republican faith groups. This can make life tricky for those of us who sit on the left side of the aisle politically and yet also sit in the pews for sacrament meeting on Sunday. Many of us have frequently found ourselves to be the only Democrats in our local ward — or at least the only ones willing to be open about it. Every Latter-day Saint Democrat is intimately familiar with the experience of having a brother or sister in their ward find them in the hallway and glance both ways before conspiratorially whispering, “I’m actually a Democrat too,” as if they don’t want anyone else to hear this darkest of all secrets. While our numbers may be on the rise and many left-leaning Latter-day Saints are happy to put on a brave face, fight the good fight and dare to be different, the truth is that doing so can be something of an isolating experience. Being the only person in your local faith community who believes what you believe — surrounded by a sea of people whose views of your deeply held principles likely range from highly skeptical, at best, to outright hostile, at worst — is never easy, and it honestly gets a little exhausting feeling the need to constantly justify your right to exist in your place of worship, even if only in your own mind. And that’s why Reid — his life, his legacy, his example — means so much. He was a devout, temple-going member of the church who was a Democrat — and not just any Democrat, but the Senate majority leader and a veritable force of nature within the party, operating at the absolute highest levels of American politics. He could wake up in the morning and read his scriptures, spend the lion’s share of his day publicly sparring with the president of the United States, get his temple recommend renewed thanks to a stake president’s interview in his Senate office (true story!), and then whip the votes necessary to pass landmark progressive legislation before heading home to do ministering visits. All in a day’s work for Brother Reid. To say that Reid set an example for thousands of his Democratic coreligionists would be a massive understatement. He was the example, the platonic ideal of our small but devoted community, the very best of us. He was the person you could point to when your Republican uncle accosted you at Thanksgiving. Because he existed, it felt like it was OK for us to exist too. And while that feeling applied to many a left-of-center Latter-day Saint, it was especially meaningful for someone like me. My missionary experiences down in Florida not only converted me to the Democratic Party, they also changed my entire life plan. My lifelong dream to be a sports journalist had been replaced by a burning desire to work in politics. To be clear, I had no idea what that meant or what it took at the time. I didn’t know a single person who had done it and I didn’t have the slightest clue how to go about even getting my foot in the door. I just knew that I felt called to do it — and because someone like me had figured out how to fight and scrap their way from a poverty-stricken childhood spent in a literal shack in the tiny town of Searchlight, Nevada, all the way to become one of the three most powerful political figures in the entire country, that meant I could probably stumble my way into some type of career in that world too. And inspired by Brother Reid’s example (and helped along by no shortage of divine providence), I did. Over the past 15 years, I’ve had the opportunity to do things that my 21-year-old self could have only dreamed of. I’ve helped elect dozens of Democrats up and down the ballot, from the statehouse to the White House. I’ve advised our party’s top leaders on matters of message and strategy. And perhaps most importantly, I’ve been fortunate enough to be able to play a role in some of the most crucial fights of our time, doing my small part to help pass laws and enact policies that have improved the lives of those hard-working families whose struggles motivated me to venture down this path in the first place. I don’t think that would have happened without Reid. He changed the trajectory of my life through his example, by fighting the good fight and inspiring others to follow behind him. I never got the chance to tell Reid what he meant to me before he passed. I crossed paths with him on a few occasions during the course of my career in Washington, but I could never get up the nerve to actually tell him how much I admired him. Turns out, it’s hard to find the right words to say when you meet your hero. Perhaps the most memorable of these interactions came in 2016. I was attending the Senate Democratic Caucus’ weekly luncheon, where my boss was making a presentation to the assembled senators. Two years earlier, our consulting firm had been hired by the Democratic National Committee to oversee an extensive effort to develop a new message for the party. I had led the project and poured my soul into the work. I was proud of what we had created. However, it was essential for our recommendations to be blessed by the party’s leaders in Congress — and seeking that blessing was what brought us to this private dining room inside the Capitol. As my boss began to address the senators, I sat alone at a table near the front, listening. But then, after a minute or two, I felt a tap on my shoulder. It was a Senate staffer, asking me to scoot my chair in so a late-arriving senator could shuffle behind me and take the empty seat to my left. I quickly moved my bag out of the way and obliged the request, and when I looked up, who did I find sitting no more than six feet from me but Reid. My stomach lurched — initially out of surprise and excitement, but then out of trepidation. A few years earlier, I had watched firsthand from the safety of the sidelines as the ever-blunt Reid harangued a fellow consultant during a similar presentation at a caucus retreat, pointedly criticizing the entire polling profession at great length before concluding by telling his target, in no uncertain terms, that he didn’t trust a word that came out of his mouth. And here was my boss, poised at the lectern, flipping through a PowerPoint presentation bursting at the seams with slide after slide of polling data that I had assembled as supporting evidence for our recommendations. Gulp. I could almost hear him licking his chops and preparing to effortlessly obliterate two whole years of my life’s work in a single moment — all while giving me a front row seat to my own annihilation. I couldn’t bring myself to do anything but stare blankly in his direction. But surprisingly, Reid didn’t say a word during the presentation. And he remained similarly silent during the question-and-answer session that followed. In fact, he barely looked up from his plate at all, as if he were transfixed by the food in front of him and somehow completely unaware of anything else happening in the room. Was he even listening, I wondered? Or was our work so bad or so boring that it didn’t even merit him expending the energy to critique it? Then, as my boss began to wrap up the discussion, Reid abruptly stood up. But rather than lobbing a rhetorical grenade in the direction of our work (and considering the source, my personal self-worth), he turned and began to head back from whence he came. In order to make his way toward the exit, he would have to once again shuffle behind my chair. Anticipating this, I scrambled to make space for my idol to pass by, breathing a silent sigh of relief in the process. As he approached my chair, rather than simply brushing past, Reid stopped in front of me and, for the first time since he entered the room, looked up and directly into my eyes. And then, in his distinctive, soft-spoken voice, he uttered the two words that anyone hopes to hear from their hero: “Good work.” Over the next few years, Reid’s health would decline to the point that he would leave his career in the nation’s capital behind and return home to Nevada, where he would live out the rest of his days in the state he loved so much. I never got another chance to try and express to him how grateful I am for all that he made possible for me and for so many others, just by being who he was and standing for what he stood for. And even if I did get that opportunity, I’m not sure I would have been capable of coherently expressing my thoughts and feelings in a way that would even begin to do justice to his impact. There’s no doubt that Sen. Reid’s lifetime of dedication to both the country he served and the party he built will earn him a place in American history. But for thousands of Latter-day Saint Democrats like me, Brother Reid’s legacy will always live a little bit closer to home — etched in the hearts and minds of those he inspired, whether or not we find the right words.

10,"1993 All-Star Game put Salt Lake City, Utah Jazz squarely on NBA map",Lee Benson,2023-02-16 04:00:00,"Dave Allred doesn’t come right out and call it Camelot. But the former Jazz public relations director does look back on the first time the Utah Jazz hosted an NBA All-Star Game with a kind of glow. “It was everything we wanted it to be,” he says, “I can’t think of anything that was a glitch. Other than the two times we went to the finals (1997 and 1998) it was the highlight of my time with the Jazz.” Allred was in his 12th year with the franchise when the NBA brought the All-Star Game to Salt Lake. He’d been with the team almost from the start of its Utah run, joining the front office a year after the team arrived in Utah from New Orleans, down and out and hemorrhaging money, borrowing from Peter to pay Paul. He’d just finished his schooling at the University of Utah and on a whim went to the Jazz offices at the Salt Palace to see if he could intern with them. “They asked how much they’d have to pay me,” he remembers. “I said I’d work for free. They said, ‘You’re hired.’” He watched from the inside as the Jazz began their steady climb to solvency and respectability, finding new ownership in Larry H. Miller and building a new arena, the Delta Center — all of it factoring into the NBA awarding Utah the 1993 All-Star Game. “It was probably the biggest event to come to Salt Lake at that time,” Allred says. “The Olympics hadn’t been awarded yet. We felt like we were the show and had the opportunity to expose Salt Lake City and the state to a worldwide audience.” Utah Jazz director of public relations Dave Allred and Christie Jackson with NIE during Jazz game against Dallas on April 8, 2002. Being part of the 1993 All-Star Game in Salt Lake City was a highlight of Allred’s career. Michael Brandy, Deseret News Behind the scenes, they were as nervous as an undrafted rookie on opening night. Says Allred, “There was always a little bit of an inferiority complex back then. We felt we had to overachieve because of the size of the market and the long-term history of the franchise. That was the mentality of the entire organization.” The Jazz weren’t the only ones worried. “I think the league was afraid there wouldn’t be enough to do in Salt Lake,” says Allred. “I think that was what was behind adding more ancillary events.” The ’93 All-Star Weekend saw the introduction of the NBA Jam Session, the celebrity game (with mostly local celebrities) and other interactive fan events that have become a staple ever since. It was also the year that killed the Legends Game, a regular event since 1984 but also a perfect storm for injuring players whose minds thought their bodies could still do what they once did. But Utah fans did get to see former Utah Stars stars Zelmo Beaty and Ron Boone , as well as Jazz announcer “ Hot” Rod Hundley , who suited up at age 58. “So that was great for us,” says Allred. NBA legends, by the way, will be in Salt Lake for this year’s game, but not to play basketball. The stars of yesteryear are part of the Lunch With a Legend ticket package: $999 for lunch with an all-time great and a ticket to the game. There’s also the Swingman package: a ticket to the game plus two days skiing and lodging in Park City for $6,399. So, yeah, the weekend has evolved, as has the host city. The population of the metro area has grown from 820,000 to 1.2 million in 30 years. There’s more to do. It didn’t hurt that the 1993 game showcased one of the greatest collections of basketball talent ever assembled on the same 94-foot floor. Nine of the All-Stars played on the Dream Team that had won Olympic gold just six months earlier in Barcelona. Eleven of them were named to the 50 greatest NBA players list revealed three years later. Sixteen of the 24 wound up in the Hall of Fame. None of the future Hall of Famers needed more than one name: Jordan, Barkley, Pippen, Shaq, Ewing, Drexler, the Admiral (David Robinson), Olajuwon, Isiah, Mullin, Dumars, Hardaway, Dominique, Richmond and, of course, Stockton and Malone. Unlike runaway dunk fests that would come later, the ’93 game was fairly competitive. And after the West and East tied in regulation at 119, it got very competitive. Led by Stockton’s five points, the West took control in overtime, winning 135-132. After that, 11 selected media members went to work deciding an MVP. Had the East won, the feeling was the vote would have gone to Michael Jordan, the reigning league MVP who led all scorers with 30 points in addition to five assists and four steals. But the West won, and when the MVP votes were tallied there were three cast for other players and four each for Stockton, who had a game-high 15 assists and nine points, and Malone, with 28 points and 10 rebounds. The Jazz stars playing on the Jazz court in the home of the Jazz were named co-MVPs, the first time that happened since Elgin Baylor and Bob Pettit shared the award in 1959. For a brief shining moment, Utah was the center of the basketball universe. In typical Stockton and Malone style, neither one wanted to command the stage for very long. “John’s first move was to get away and be with his family,” remembers Allred of the always reclusive Stockton. “Karl had a little more interest in the media, but not a lot. They weren’t clamoring for more interviews, I can tell you. John and Karl did what was required of them and then they were gone.” Allred’s — and the Jazz’s — time in the spotlight was done. Pretty much a perfect ending to a glitchless day.",sports,10
11,Debt ceiling: What is it and why does it matter? | Opinion,Michael Kofoed,2023-02-16 04:00:00,"In Robert Redford’s breakout role in “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid” (resulting in both a film festival and a ski resort named after his titular character), Butch and Sundance are cornered by a posse on a cliff with a river below. Faced with either fighting their way out or holing up forever, Butch proposes jumping. Sundance, however, confesses that he is afraid to jump because he cannot swim. Butch laughs and exclaims, “Are you crazy? The fall will probably kill ya!” The two take the plunge and their escapades continue. Much like Butch and Sundance, Congress has, once again, backed itself up against the debt ceiling cliff with few good options. Secretary Janet Yellen announced that the U.S. Department of the Treasury will have to take “extraordinary measures” (which will launch a protracted political fight) or risk defaulting on the debt by refusing to pay interest payments (akin to jumping off a cliff). Like it or not, Congress must make this difficult bargain to allow the federal government to pay its bills. However, the debt ceiling is a uniquely American institution — Denmark is the only other country with one — and in its current form actually causes fiscal irresponsibility and political dysfunction. Throughout America’s history, Congress had few ways to raise revenue to fight wars or build infrastructure. When there was no income tax, the Treasury imposed strong tariffs on imports or taxed the consumption of specific items, such as alcohol. Thus, in times of national emergency, Congress would issue debt for a specific amount or project. This policy meant there were various types of government issued bonds and securities for expenses such as the Civil War, the Panama Canal and the transcontinental railroad. Marketing and maintaining all of these different asset classes proved to be complex and costly. In World War I, to defeat the Kaiser and support the efforts of the doughboys sent “over there,” Congress authorized the first, consolidated, general government treasury bond. This action gave the Wilson administration the flexibility needed to finance the war efforts and maintain the government at home. However, as a compromise, Congress limited the amount of debt issued and, in a strange twist of financial fate, separated the debt limit authorization from the normal budget process. The U.S. Constitution gives the House of Representatives the “power of the purse” in the Appropriations Clause so it would separate the power to set budgets from the executive branch and ensure that the elected officials closest to the “People” would primarily spend the public money. The “Full Faith and Credit” clause of the Constitution prioritizes interest rate payments over all other spending such as defense or entitlements. These combined constitutional obligations made the United States treasury bond the quintessential risk-free asset. Since other investment types — such as corporate bonds from the private sector, municipal bonds from city governments or even foreign debt (for example, Greek bonds during the Euro Zone crisis) — posed a risk of default or skipped interest payments, the U.S. government assured investors that it would also be good to its word. This premier position on the global market means our government can borrow at lower rates and can easily find investors who wish to use Treasury bills to diversify their portfolios. Every type of risk is now measured against the probability of Congress paying interest on the debt. If it was to become more risky, then all of us would pay a premium on everything from homes to cars to student loans, because of politicians playing chicken with public finances. Separation of the debt limit decision from the regular budget process causes severely misaligned incentives. Members of Congress can tuck their favorite spending gimmes or tax cuts into the budget and then months or years later, when the bill comes, use it for political leverage. They can appear “fiscally conservative” and scream about debt, never mind that their fiscal binge has come and gone. The debt ceiling is not, as commonly supposed , akin to cutting up a shopping addict’s credit cards, but rather it’s refusing to pay the tab on a three-course meal already consumed. To refuse to lift the debt ceiling and claim to be a good manager of the people’s resources is disingenuous at best, and incompetent governance at worse. The national debt is a huge concern especially as interest rates rise, Social Security and military pensions mature, and Medicare continues to balloon. Congress should link the debt debate to the normal budget process and do the job that the American people impaneled them to do: conduct the nation’s business in a responsible manner. Michael S.

12,"Adoption costs, policy: How will a new Utah bill help? | Opinion",Robin Fretwell Wilson,2023-02-16 04:00:00,"Adoptions are expensive, with average costs in the range of $20,000 to $50,000 and higher. As an adopted child of parents with very modest means, I can tell you how important it is for the expenses of adopting to be transparent so families can make informed choices. According to the most recent national adoption data available, 1,281 children were adopted in Utah in 2019. Almost half of those adoptions were facilitated by private adoption agencies. And after the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision, it’s likely that the number of adoptions, in Utah and beyond, will increase in the coming years. This week, Utah legislators are considering an innovative law that increases the opportunities for adoption in the state, offering hope that more children might have forever families. The legislation ( SB154 ) does three things: expands support for adoption by providing transparency about costs and consistent reporting of fees, facilitates the difficult choice facing birth mothers about whether to relinquish a child, and tries to grow the adoption marketplace. The bill prohibits fees for services not provided, and Medicaid continues to be there for birth mothers. Because we cannot write good policy without data, the bill standardizes the reporting of fees and relays this information back to legislative committees and the Judicial Council. This consistency and transparency will allow families to compare apples to apples when considering adoption. I know costs mattered to my parents. When my parents adopted my sister and me, my dad was a Navy welder and my mom was a stay-at-home mother. They literally cleaned people’s garages to have enough money for their daughters. As the bill’s sponsor, Sen. Chris Wilson, R-Logan, has said, it’s really important that welders, nurses, firefighters, teachers, janitors — every person who wants to adopt — can afford to do so. Helping families compare fees is an important step in bringing down costs. Next, the bill provides a novel way for helping mothers make the difficult choice to relinquish a child. It allows birth mothers to direct, insofar as it is possible, the placement of a child in a family that makes sense to her. Adoption agencies are allowed and encouraged to follow “the good faith wishes of the birth mother as to optimal placement.” We know this happens in private placement adoption. And this makes sense in agency adoptions, too. A birth mother who feels unable to raise a child should be able to have confidence that if she chooses adoption, the child will be raised in a family that provides the best opportunities. I have no idea what considerations my birth mother had to take into account when deciding to give me up for adoption. But I can say this: as a mother myself, I know it must take incredible courage to break the bond with one’s child. When a birth mother comes to this difficult juncture, we need to do all that we can to respect and honor her wishes. Utah is not the only state to do this — Arizona and South Carolina allow birth mothers to express preferences and guide the placement of a child being relinquished for private adoption. Finally, Utah’s bill consciously seeks to grow the adoption marketplace, both by increasing the diversity of adoption service providers but also by according respect to all qualified couples seeking to adopt. Both gay couples and religious families represent a sizable fraction of all those who adopt. The bill allows faith-based adoption agencies to remain true to their religious teachings and practices and thus gives room for groups associated with specific faith traditions to continue to help Utah’s families — and it will allow faith groups to again take up the mantle of assisting Utah children who might otherwise languish in foster care. We do not want to drive faith-based agencies from this space. They are extremely valuable in the placement of children into loving families. Protecting the vulnerable is not only a Christian commitment but is shared, to my knowledge, by every faith tradition. At the same time, this bill is truly innovative. It places all the adoption agencies that serve Utah residents — whether birth mothers or prospective adoptive parents — into a consortium. Every qualified prospective family will know that there is an agency available to serve them. This consortium guarantees every perspective adoptive family the respect they deserve. There is no greater gift for a child than having two loving parents and a permanent home with the knowledge that this family will be there for you across time. Utah’s bill would go a long way toward giving children that security. It should be signed into law and serve as a template for adoption policy across the nation.

Overall customer satisfaction with cars fell by 1.3% from 2022 to 2023, according to a study Many luxury carmakers gained points, while some mainstream brands fell behind. After interviewing 4,708 customers chosen at random between Jan 2022 and Jan 2023, the American Customer Satisfaction Index concluded overall customer satisfaction fell to a score of 77 out of 100, down from 78 in 2022. Here are the numbers published online. The study found that drivers who own a so-called mass-market car are most satisfied with comfort, dependability, driving performance, and safety; these areas all scored 81 out of 100. Drivers are least satisfied with warranties (75) and fuel economy (74). In the luxury segment, drivers are happy with comfort (84), interior (83), and safety (83), though warranties and fuel economy sit at 79 and 76, respectively. Some car companies are celebrating as you read this: Toyota, Chevrolet, Chrysler, Acura, and Infiniti rose by 1%, 3%, 3%, 8%, and 9%, respectively compared to 2021. Others are likely rethinking at least some aspects of their business model: Hyundai and Mazda both dropped by 1%, Honda fell by 6%, Dodge dropped by 5%, while Volvo and Lincoln each lost a percentage point over the past year. Japanese and South Korean manufacturers collectively gained a percentage point, meaning they’re tied for first with European brands at 79.

Juab tallied 138.5 team points and qualified 17 wrestlers into the semifinals as it enjoys a comfortable lead over second-place Morgan, which tallied 110 points in the first day. For the girls, after winning last year’s inaugural combined 3A/2A/1A state championship Grantsville is in the driver’s seat to repeat after qualifying 12 wrestlers into the semifinals and tallying 129 points.

17,Abortion clinics to shut down under Utah bill,Katie McKellar,2023-02-16 03:32:17,"Utah’s Republican-controlled Legislature is not waiting for the end result of the lawsuit currently tying up Utah’s trigger law that bans almost all abortions in Utah. Instead, Utah lawmakers on Wednesday advanced a pair of bills to clamp down, clarify and in some areas of code further restrict Utah’s abortion laws. Both HB467 , a bill that would among other measures seek to ban abortion clinics in Utah, and HB297 , a bill to expand services for rape victims while also reinforcing an existing requirement that medical providers first verify a rape was in some way reported to law enforcement, won approval from the House Judiciary Committee despite protests from Democrats. Both bills would also completely strip out Utah’s rape and incest exemption after 18 weeks of pregnancy. While Utah’s trigger law that would ban almost all abortions (with exemptions) is on hold as it’s challenged in court , Utah’s current law bans abortions after 18 weeks of pregnancy, except in cases where the mother’s life is at risk, if the pregnancy was a result of rape or incest or when the fetus has a brain defect or abnormality. Audience members express their approval of comments in the House Judiciary committee as they hear HB0467 and HB297 at the Capitol on Wednesday, Feb. 15, 2023. Scott G Winterton, Deseret News After an overflowing public hearing packed with supporters and detractors, the House committee voted to endorse both bills. They now go to the House floor for consideration. Some anti-abortion advocates urged lawmakers to support the bill, while others scolded Utah lawmakers for not going far enough. From the other side, detractors included medical professionals who urged legislators not to further limit abortion options and to stay out of deeply personal and complex decisions that they argued should be left between women and their doctors. The bill sponsored by Rep. Karianne Lisonbee, R-Clearfield, includes several measures. It would, among other provisions: Rep. Kera Birkeland, R-Morgan, speaks on HB297 in the House Judiciary Committee at the Capitol in Salt Lake City on Wednesday, Feb. 15, 2023. Scott G Winterton, Deseret News “In Utah, we deeply value human life in all stages and in all circumstances. It’s the state’s responsibility to protect the most vulnerable (including) the unborn,” Lisonbee told the House committee. “At the same time, we have worked closely with area hospitals and doctors to ensure that our statute strikes the very best balance of protecting innocent life and protecting women.” Lisonbee said she also expects the court case to be resolved by January of next year, when the ban on clinics would take effect, which she argued would dramatically reduce clinic abortions anyway. Medical providers including Misha Pangasa, an OB-GYN who provides abortion care in both hospitals and clinics, spoke against the bill, arguing it would restrict access and increase costs for women by requiring abortions in hospitals and cutting off clinic access. “This bill will remove the option for clinic-based care and result in more pain and suffering for people who are already going through some of the most difficult times of their lives,” Pangasa said. Gabby Saunders, lobbyist for the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said “Doctors and hospitals are not used to performing abortions, especially in the ER.” She said one doctor last year called an abortion doctor seeking help “because a woman had come in who had a placenta rupture.” “He needed to perform an abortion to save her life. Instead of doing that, he was so confused and scared by the laws and of losing his license that he called this abortion doctor, de-scrubbed, and continued to let this patient bleed out on the table,” Saunders said. “No,” she continued. “It is not going to be a safer place.” Jasmin Charles speaks against HB0467 in the House Judiciary committee at the Capitol on Wednesday, Feb. 15, 2023. Scott G Winterton, Deseret News Saunders also argued clinics “exist because it is an option that is more affordable for many women that will be seeking this exemption.” She said a woman who may lose her life or “watch her child suffer an incredibly painful death will be prevented that option because they know they’re going to have to spend somewhere between $5,000 to $20,000 to do that.” Marina Lowe, legislative and policy counsel for American Civil Liberties Union of Utah, said she appreciates Lisonbee’s bill for providing “greater clarification for doctors” and using “more medically accurate language in the exceptions than was originally in code.” “However,” Lowe said, “rather than allowing the court process to play out — and by the way, the idea that litigation would be resolved by January is extremely unlikely — HB467 attempts to constructively circumvent the judicial process.” It would effectively “convert Utah hospitals from Cache County to Washington County into abortion clinics,” Lowe said. Lisonbee argued her bill would not “pigeon hole anybody into an in-patient hospital setting.” She said “There are lots of doctors who currently handle abortions in a hospital setting and an emergency setting that will continue to do so.” “They have worked with us very closely to ensure that the language in this bill allows them to safely take care of the women under their care,” Lisonbee said. Lisonbee also said she understands “people who make a huge profit in the abortion clinic setting have the desire to keep their profit, their market share. But in Utah, we have already passed our trigger law. When the courts decide and uphold that, there will be no elective abortions anymore. So there will be very few abortions happening.” The committee voted 9-2, with two Democrats voting against it, to endorse the bill and forward it to the full House. Immediately after Lisonbee’s bill won approval, the House committee also considered a bill sponsored by Rep. Kera Birkeland, R-Morgan. With HB297 , Birkeland wants to expand services for rape victims while also reinforcing an existing requirement that medical providers, before performing an abortion, first verify the rape was in some way reported to law enforcement. Birkeland started her presentation of the bill by making it clear “this bill does not create a requirement that women go to police before receiving medical care or abortions. That bill was passed long before I became a lawmaker. So that debate already happened.” Birkeland’s bill would: An earlier version of her bill would have required the woman receiving the abortion to give the physician “a copy of the case report by the applicable law enforcement agency” or “sign a certification that the woman reported to law enforcement the incident.” However, in the committee hearing Birkeland amended the bill to require the physician performing the abortion to simply “maintain an accurate record as to the manner in which the physician conducted the verification.” “It can be something as simple as a form where they strike a box saying the woman told me she has a case number, (or) the woman gave me an affidavit, (or) the victim told me she just called, and I’m taking that as her word, right, word of mouth,” Birkeland said. “It could be all kinds of things.” Birkeland’s younger sister, Samantha Hansen , has publicly opposed Birkeland’s bill while sharing her own story as a rape survivor. Hansen told the Deseret News she didn’t attend Wednesday’s hearing because she recently contracted COVID-19, but issued a written statement saying she was “pleased” Birkeland’s bill was amended “and a case number or signed affidavit is no longer needed to access abortion.” “As someone who has lived the awful reality of rape, and pregnancy as a result of rape, I find myself most in favor of SB88 ,” Hansen said, pointing to a bill being sponsored by Sen. Kathleen Riebe, D-Cottonwood Heights, that would remove Utah’s requirement that a physician verify a report has been made to law enforcement before performing an abortion. That bill has yet to receive a public hearing. Hansen, however, said has “always and will continue to support the portion” of Birkeland’s bill that would provide more resources to rape victims, “and I most certainly support her endeavors to create better systems within law enforcement.” Birkeland argued her bill is focused more than anything on holding rapists accountable while “empowering women who’ve had some of the most important and sacred powers already taken from them.” Nicholeen Peck listens to testimony in the House Judiciary committee on HB0467 and HB297 at the Capitol on Wednesday, Feb. 15, 2023. Scott G Winterton, Deseret News Nicholeen Peck, president of the anti-abortion Worldwide Organization for Women, spoke in favor of Birkeland’s bill. She told lawmakers her husband was adopted as a child, and when they were able to find his birth mother in 2019, she “explained the unfortunate circumstance that happened to her.” “She said, ‘I was going to get an abortion. I don’t know why I didn’t. But now I’m really glad I didn’t,’” Peck said. “And You know what? I am too. Eternally glad that she didn’t. So I appreciate (Birkeland’s bill) for future families like mine.” David Turok, an OB-GYN, spoke against Birkeland’s bill, saying he’s “perplexed” by Utah’s reporting requirement that her bill is structured around. “If we know that the vast majority of (rape victims) already do not report, and the main goal is to get people to better care, then I cannot understand why you wouldn’t let the people who have thousands of hours of training ... be the venue and the vehicle for reporting rather than already overburdened and challenged law enforcement officers,” Turok said. Jasmin Charles, a physician associate, said in the past she worked primarily with vulnerable populations and helping women out of intimate partner violence. “I love that we are looking at victim advocacy,” she said, but the reporting requirement creates a barrier for victims that “we can hardly even begin to understand.” Audience members express their disapproval of comments in the House Judiciary committee as they hear HB0467 and HB297 at the Capitol on Wednesday, Feb. 15, 2023.

18,Damar Hamlin Super Bowl jacket with Jesus design sparks backlash,Kelsey Dallas,2023-02-16 03:18:38,"Three days after taking part in Super Bowl festivities wearing a faith-themed jacket, Damar Hamlin has apologized for causing offense. “After talking with my parents I understand how my coat could have offended some people. It was never my intentions to hurt or disrespect anyone,” the Buffalo Bills safety tweeted Wednesday. The coat in question featured an unusual illustration of Jesus on the cross, alongside a variety of other religious symbols and words. It comes from Kanye West’s fashion line, according to The Associated Press . In his Wednesday tweet thread, Hamlin said he saw the coat’s design as “abstract art.” “It says ‘Eternal’ (and) I am Eternally thankful to my Savior,” he said. Former NFL star Adrian Peterson was among those who criticized Hamlin’s fashion statement. “This is blasphemy!! ... I find this disrespectful!!,” the running back said earlier this week, according to The Christian Post . Peterson later noted on Instagram that he’d had a chance to connect with Hamlin and share his concerns. He said the conversation helped him see that Hamlin didn’t mean to be disrespectful, although it didn’t convince him to embrace the jacket’s design. “Damar, I have respect and love for you and I wish you nothing but the best, but I just can’t rock with that jacket. I feel like there are a lot people, young and old, looking up to you and with power and influence comes great responsibility,” Peterson wrote on Instagram. Hamlin has been in the spotlight since he collapsed on the field during a Jan. 2 primetime game against the Cincinnati Bengals. He went into cardiac arrest and spent multiple days in critical condition before he was well enough to be transferred to a medical center in Buffalo and then cleared to go home. Hamlin was at the Super Bowl to take part in a pregame ceremony honoring his recovery and the work of his caretakers, The Associated Press reported. “The NFL honored the Bills and Bengals training and medical staffs and first responders who treated the 24-year-old from the Pittsburgh area on the field, and the staff at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center, where he spent nearly a week recovering,” the article said. My beliefs and Relationship with God is not tied to symbolic images. I will learn from this and continue to walk in Love as I ALWAYS have. Matthew 7:1-5 🫶🏾💕 In his tweets Wednesday, Hamlin assured fans that he will learn from the jacket controversy. “I will learn from this and continue to walk in Love as I ALWAYS have,” he said. Hamlin also pointed people to a Bible passage about refraining from judging others. “Do not judge, or you too will be judged. For in the same way you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you. Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother’s eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye? How can you say to your brother, ‘Let me take the speck out of your eye,’ when all the time there is a plank in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother’s eye,” reads Matthew 7:1-5 .",sports,18
19,Kyrie Irving to miss Mavericks’ game versus Nuggets with back injury,Associated Press,2023-02-16 03:03:31,"DENVER — Dallas Mavericks guard Kyrie Irving was ruled out Wednesday night against the Western Conference-leading Denver Nuggets due to tightness in his lower back. It’s the last game for the Mavericks before the All-Star break. Mavericks coach Jason Kidd didn’t elaborate pregame what happened with Irving, only saying that, “It happens. Could have been from a fall in that game the other night.” Kidd thought Irving would participate in the All-Star Game this weekend in Salt Lake City. The Mavericks acquired Irving as part of a trade with Brooklyn on Feb. 6. Irving averaged 28.3 points in his first four games with the Mavericks. He and Luka Doncic have taken the floor twice together since the trade and have dropped both games. In addition to Irving, the Mavericks were without forward Davis Bertans (calf), guard Tim Hardaway Jr. (hamstring) and forward/center Maxi Kleber (hamstring) against Nikola Jokic and the Nuggets. Denver guard Jamal Murray was ruled by coach Michael Malone out due to inflammation in his right knee.",sports,19

Wilson was at the Metropolitan State Hospital when he collapsed and died, according to TMZ. TMZ said Wilson was arrested for vandalism in August and was in police custody since. He was declared incompetent to stand trial and was transferred to the hospital, which specializes in mental health care. Oakland police chief LeRonne Armstrong fired by mayor Wilson played cornerback for four seasons for Stanford from 2001-2004. He caught an interception in each season he spent with the team before the Detroit Lions selected him in the 3rd round of the 2004 NFL Draft. He played for Detroit from 2005-2007 before suffering a career-ending Achilles injury. He totaled 89 tackles and eight pass breakups in the NFL. Wilson was arrested several times after his career ended. In 2016, he was shot by an Oregon homeowner after attempting to break into a home while naked.

21,Rex Ryan a ‘top candidate’ for Broncos defensive coordinator job,Ryan Glasspiegel,2023-02-16 02:41:35,"Rex Ryan may be Mile High-bound. Ian Rapoport and Mike Garafolo of NFL Media reported Wednesday that Ryan “has emerged as a top candidate” for the Broncos’ defensive coordinator job. Ryan interviewed with Sean Payton , Denver’s new head coach, earlier this week. The 60-year-old Ryan was head coach of the Jets from 2009-14, and reached two AFC championship games in his tenure, before the team missed the playoffs for four straight seasons. After that he coached the Bills for two seasons with a total record of 16-15. Neither season ended in a postseason berth. He has been working as a studio analyst at ESPN since 2017. Before landing the Jets’ job, Ryan was defensive coordinator of the Ravens from 2005-08; he was defensive line coach on Baltimore’s 2000 Super Bowl championship team. Ryan had previously said that his job with the Bills would be his last NFL coaching stop. “This is definitely going to be it,” Ryan told USA Today in September 2015. “This is my last stop in coaching, and then when my days are up, I’ll turn it over to the younger generation. I’m not going anywhere else. There are always going to be people that judge you, but that’s OK.” Given his previous success in the role, stature as a former head coach and the general quality of life of working on TV versus long-hour grinding in the NFL coaching ranks, it would stand to reason that the price tag to lure Ryan as a coordinator would be high. Rob Walton, an heir to the Walmart fortune, finalized the Walton-Penner purchase of the Broncos for $4.65 billion in June. His son-in-law, Greg Penner, is chairman of Walmart and CEO of the Broncos. Altogether, the family is the wealthiest NFL ownership group. The Broncos were a disappointing 5-12 this past season. After trading multiple first-round picks to the Seahawks for Russell Wilson and backing up the Brinks truck for the QB with a $245 million extension, the expectation was that they would be Super Bowl contenders. Instead, the team failed to have a cohesive offense and head coach Nathaniel Hackett was fired during his first year on the job.",sports,21
22,Max Scherzer: This team-up with Justin Verlander will go better,Mike Puma,2023-02-16 02:40:55,"PORT ST. LUCIE — Max Scherzer has spent most of his career on teams that surrounded him with other stud starting pitchers, whether it was Stephen Strasburg, Clayton Kershaw or Jacob deGrom. For the second time in his career, Scherzer will belong to a rotation that includes Justin Verlander. The dynamic duo pitched for the Tigers from 2010-14 and have been reunited this spring training, after Verlander signed with the Mets in December. “I know we pitched together for five years , but we have actually been apart for eight now,” Scherzer said Wednesday at Clover Park. “[After Verlander’s] experiences [in Detroit] and Houston, it’s going to be real fun to start comparing notes, because the game has evolved since we played together. “It’s going to be real fascinating to see his mind on how he sees how you attack different guys and things that kind of work for each of us. Things that make him successful and make me successful and where things line up.” Scherzer and Verlander, by their own admissions, were hardly the best of friends during their Tigers years. But Scherzer said he expects a different kind of relationship this time. “We’re at different stages of our careers and more importantly we’re at different stages of our lives,” Scherzer said. “Things will definitely be different now. I really don’t see that being an issue whatsoever.” Verlander said he and Scherzer train at the same gym in the West Palm Beach area and worked out together over the winter. “I’m really looking forward to being here with him again,” Verlander said. “We’re obviously in different situations in our lives and I think we could both look back at our time in Detroit together, where we had such an incredible team and weren’t able to achieve the ultimate goal. So hopefully, reunited here, we can achieve that.” Scherzer, 38, pitched to a 2.29 ERA in 23 starts (145 ¹/₃ innings pitched) last season. He was placed on the injured list twice with a strained oblique, prompting him to focus this offseason on workouts that he hopes will lessen the possibility of a recurrence. The goal, he said, is 200 innings pitched this season. “You have got to be nimble on how you train and for me it’s figuring everything out, exactly what you have got to do,” Scherzer said. “That’s the fun part. That’s the challenge. You have to figure yourself out in order to be durable. You’re never done learning in this game and especially as you age you get new challenges put in front of you. This is a challenge I have got to jump over.”",sports,22

30,"Biden Justice Department subpoena is ‘unconstitutional,’ Mike Pence says regarding Jan. 6 investigation",Joshua Lee,2023-02-16 01:14:11,"In the midst of an Iowa trip, former Vice President Mike Pence told the press Wednesday he will “fight” a subpoena from Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith requesting documents related to former President Donald Trump’s actions surrounding Jan. 6. Pence said he believed the subpoena, which also requires him to testify before a grand jury, is “unconstitutional.” “No vice president has ever been subject to a subpoena to testify about the president with whom they served,” Pence said. Pence recently published a book recounting some of his discussions with Trump leading up to Jan. 6 and his role as vice president in the congressional certification of the 2020 presidential election results. The former president requested Pence reject votes from a number of states. But Pence chose to preside over the certification proceedings, as prescribed by the U.S. Constitution. Pence was subpoenaed by Smith last week, according to NBC News. Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed Smith to lead the investigation of Trump’s handling of classified documents and his role in the Capitol riot. “We’re prepared to take this fight into the court, and if need be take it to the Supreme Court,” Pence told reporters. While he said he expects Trump to fight the subpoena as well on executive privilege grounds, he indicated his strategy is different. “My fight is on the separation of powers,” Pence said. He said that on Jan. 6 he was fulfilling his constitutional duty, not as member of the executive branch, but as a member of the legislative branch in his capacity as president of the Senate. He said that this affords him the same constitutional “speech or debate” clause protections extended to members of Congress. The purpose of the clause, found in Article 1, section 6 , is to reassure members of Congress that anything they say in the halls of Congress cannot implicate them in legal proceedings. The courts have interpreted the language broadly, even including congressional staff activity. Pence’s legal strategy has been called “novel” but “plausible” by Mark Rozell at George Mason University. “It is one of these constitutionally gray areas in which there could reasonably be different interpretations of the vice president’s role,” Rozell told the Wall Street Journal. If the courts find, as Pence claims, that he was acting in his legislative role as president of the Senate, then compelling his compliance to a subpoena would likely violate separation of powers between the legislative, executive and judicial branches of the federal government. “My fight against the DOJ subpoena, very simply, is on defending the prerogatives that I had as president of the Senate to preside over the joint session of Congress on January 6th,” he said. Politico reported that during Pence’s comments Wednesday to reporters he reiterated that Trump’s “reckless” rhetoric on Jan. 6 was “wrong” and that it endangered him and his family. Pence is considering a 2024 campaign for president, potentially challenging his former boss directly for the GOP presidential nomination. Last year he was asked if he’d support Trump in 2024. “Well, there might be somebody else I’d prefer more,” he told the crowd. Pence said he would take the holidays to talk with his family about what he wants to do. “We’ll be thinking about the future — ours and the nation’s, and I’ll keep you posted,” he said last year. His activity in Iowa this week rallying conservatives around “parental rights” suggests he is seriously considering a presidential bid. And if money is another indication, Pence’s think tank, Advancing American Freedom, is spending $1 million in digital, television and radio ads in the Hawkeye state, the first to vote next year in the GOP presidential primary.",sports,30

The organization waived wide receiver Kristian Wilkerson, cornerback Tae Hayes and kicker Quinn Nordin, according to the NFL transaction wire. Wilkerson, 26, had resided on injured reserve due to a concussion since last August’s 53-man roster deadline. The 2020 undrafted record-setter from Southeast Missouri State signed to New England’s practice squad in September of his rookie season after spending training camp with the Tennessee Titans . He served as an elevation for four games through 2021, catching four passes for 42 yards and two touchdowns on eight targets. Hayes, 25, joined the practice squad in December after returning an interception for a touchdown in the preseason versus New England. A 53-man roster promotion followed as the Appalachian State product recorded three tackles through two contests and 32 snaps to conclude the regular season. Undrafted in 2019, Hayes made previous stops with the Jacksonville Jaguars , Miami Dolphins , Minnesota Vikings , Arizona Cardinals and Carolina Panthers . The 2022 USFL champion has appeared in 13 NFL games. Nordin, 24, reverted to New England’s non-football injury list last June after clearing waivers in a move that tolled his contract. The former Michigan specialist entered the NFL with the Patriots as undrafted rookie in 2021, and outlasted the roster deadline following a preseason in which he went 6-of-8 field goals and 4-of-7 extra points. After being placed on injured reserve that fall, Nordin finished his initial regular season on the practice squad before reaching a futures pact. All three will be subject to the NFL’s claiming period on Thursday. The 2023 league year begins March 15 at 4 p.m. ET.",sports,45

47,Rays bring stacked starting rotation into 2023,Karen Loftus,2023-02-15 22:36:44,"Orlando, Fla. (WFLA) – This offseason, the Rays signed Zach Eflin to a record three-year, $40 million-dollar deal – the most the franchise has ever paid a free agent. He joins four returning Rays players in their starting rotation, which should prove to be one of the strongest facets of this team—just ask fellow starter, Jeffrey Springs. “I don’t know, to put one word on it? Nasty?” Springs said of the quality of their starting pitchers. “I just watched Zach [Eflin] and Shane [McClanahan] and Glas [Tyler Glasnow] throw bullpens and it’s like they hadn’t missed a beat. The stuff’s unbelievable. You add Eflin— I actually played catch with him today, got to watch him on TV last year in the postseason. Drew [Rasmussen], you know, it’s going to be a lot of fun.” “I feel like we have six, seven, eight guys that could be easily in anybody’s rotation,” said starting pitcher Shane McClanahan. “Easily anybody’s one-two. I think that just shows the depth we have.” McClanahan also said that beyond their starting pitchers, they also have the deepest bullpen staff he’s seen in his time with the Rays. But now they need to carry that over to the field this season. “We’re all excited about where our rotation is,” said Rays Manager Kevin Cash. “We talked about yesterday the depth that we have behind it, but it’s kind of on us to go out there and back up whatever’s being said. We would expect that these guys—they work well together. There’s no doubt that the talent is there.” This stacked pitching staff is one of the reasons Eflin ultimately decided to sign with the Rays. “You look at all the guys that we have and everybody can post numbers,” Eflin said. “Everybody can keep us in a ballgame to win the game ultimately. So it’s going to be fun to work with a staff like that. I had an awesome opportunity to work with a great staff in Philly and this is just right up there with it—if not better—so I’m really excited to get going and really know these guys inside and out.”",sports,47

58,Roku soars past revenue expectations as it bets on streaming devices to boost growth,Lauren Forristal,2023-02-15 21:46:14,"Over a month after Roku announced its first Roku-branded TVs, which will launch in the U.S. in spring 2023, the hardware company reported its quarterly earnings this afternoon, which showed Roku beat its own revenue expectations, reporting a total net revenue of $867.1 million for Q4. The company previously cautioned investors of a shaky fourth quarter, predicting total revenue at around $800 million, a 7.5% decrease year over year. In Q3, Roku had total revenue of $761 million. Analysts predicted a year-over-year decline of 7% to $804.19 million. However, the company’s Q1 2023 guidance is still cautious of the current macroenvironment. Roku predicts a total net revenue of $700 million. Also, Roku recently announced that it surpassed 70 million active accounts globally in 2022, an impressive milestone for the company. It had 65.4 million active accounts in Q3. For comparison, rival Tubi, Fox’s free ad-supported streaming TV service, revealed yesterday that it reached 64 million monthly active users . Plus, Roku had a 19% year-over-year increase in global streaming hours, with a total of 87.4 billion streaming hours in 2022 and 23.9 billion for the fourth quarter. Despite the growth in accounts, Roku continued to see operating losses widen to $249.9 million, compared to a loss of $147 million in the prior quarter. Due to the economic challenges, Roku wrote in an SEC filing in November that it planned to cut 200 jobs in the U.S. between Q4 2022 and Q1 2023. “We plan to continue to improve our operating expense profile to better manage through the challenging macro environment while building on our platform’s monetization and engagement tools and partnerships,” the company wrote in its letter to shareholders. “Through a combination of operating expense control and revenue growth, we are committed to a path that delivers positive adjusted EBITDA for full year 2024. Our platform and industry leadership positions us well for reaccelerated revenue growth as the ad market recovers and the shift to TV streaming continues.” The company added that Roku’s operating system (OS) , which will power the forthcoming Roku-branded TVs, grew to 38% of units sold in the U.S. Q4 2022, per NPD. This means Roku OS continues to be among the top-selling smart TV OS in the U.S. The new Roku-branded TVs , announced last month, were another significant move for the company. Roku recently closed a few deals with major companies to boost its streaming business. For instance, the company closed a deal with Warner Bros. Discovery , getting 2,000 hours of movies and TV shows, including HBO’s “Westworld,” “The Bachelor,” “Cake Boss” and “Say Yes to the Dress,” among others. Earlier this week, the company struck an exclusive programming deal with Pocket.watch , a kids and family entertainment studio, to bring more children’s content to the Roku Channel. Also, Roku partnered with DoorDash earlier this month to give customers a free six-month subscription to DashPass and launched interactive shoppable ads for DoorDash businesses on Roku devices.

71,Stimulus Check Tax Review By IRS For Middle-Class California Refunds,Md Shahnawaz,2023-02-16 05:35:28,"Economy Stimulus Check Stimulus Check Tax Review By IRS For Middle-Class California Refunds By Md Shahnawaz - February 16, 2023 Stimulus Check The people of California have been waiting for a very long time to know their tax fate made by IRS regarding the stimulus check received from them. The IRS recently announced that several of the US states had offered stimulus payments to their residents and this payment might not be taxed by them. Under the special state refunds or payments given to millions of Americans all over the nation during 2022, Californians also received stimulus checks and are eager to know if they need to report it as a source of income. California Stimulus Check Payment Taxation The residents of California had previously received MCTRs (Tax Refunds for the Middle Class) that were meant to support people during the time of financial crises. The state government shelled out its surplus funds worth a whopping $9 billion to provide stimulus checks to 31 million beneficiaries. This was reported by the Tax Board Franchise of California. Some weeks back, the IRS informed the taxpayers to hold off on their tax filing for the year 2022 since they were determining the standard taxation status in relation to these special stimulus payments. Eventually, IRS stated that the California MCTRs will not be taxed. This is indeed great news for Californians. IRS Gives Good News The agency has determined that the people of California have time before their next tax filing. On the other hand, this announcement from IRS arrived later in the California Golden State since they have already started giving out the form 1099-MISC to their residents. This form is used by people whose monthly income is over $600 and who must use it for tax filing. Nonetheless, this good news from IRS is a huge tax relief for Californians. The people will have to file by the 18 th of April which is the Tax Day for 2023.

73,SEC proposes tougher rules as part of its crypto custody crackdown,Cointelegraph By    Brayden Lindrea,2023-02-16 02:51:53,"A five-member panel of the United States Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) has voted 4-1 in favor of a proposal that may make it more difficult for cryptocurrency firms to serve as digital asset custodians in the future. The proposal, which is yet to be officially approved by the SEC, recommends amendments to the “2009 Custody Rule” will apply to custodians of “all assets” including cryptocurrencies, according to a Feb. 15 statement from SEC Chairman Gary Gensler. Gensler stated that currently, some crypto trading platforms that are offering custody services are not actual “qualified custodians.” According to the SEC, a qualified custodian is generally a federal or state-chartered bank or savings association, trust company, a registered broker-dealer, a registered futures commission merchant, or a foreign financial institution. In order to become a “qualified custodian” under the newly proposed rules, U.S. and offshore firms would additionally need to ensure that all custodied assets — including cryptocurrencies — are properly segregated, while these custodians will be required to jump through additional hoops such as annual audits from public accountants, among other transparency measures. We @SECGov just proposed to expand & enhance the role of qualified custodians when registered investment advisers custody assets on behalf of investors. Thru our rule, investors would get the time-tested protections—and qualified custodians—they deserve. What does this mean? ⬇️ pic.twitter.com/RerUGnpArI While Gensler said these amendments would “expand the scope” to all asset classes, he specifically took a shot at the crypto industry: “When these platforms go bankrupt—something we’ve seen time and again recently—investors’ assets often have become property of the failed company, leaving investors in line at the bankruptcy court,” the SEC Chairman added. Gensler also pointed to the industry's track record to suggest that few crypto firms would be reliable enough to serve as qualified custodians: However, not every SEC member is on board with Gensler’s plans. While the proposal isn’t “regulation by enforcement” per se, Commissioner Hester Peirce said “the latest SEC statement seems designed for immediate effect” to take down the crypto industry: As for the proposal itself, Peirce believes it would do more harm than good. She explained that such stringent measures will force investors to remove their assets from entities that have developed sufficient safeguarding procedures to mitigate and prevent fraud and theft: As for the next steps, Peirce noted the agency will soon schedule in a 60-day comment period once the proposal has been published in the Federal Register. Related: US lawmakers and experts debate SEC’s role in crypto regulation However, the commissioner is concerned that this timeframe isn’t sufficient to allow the public to analyze all aspects of the proposal. Those who voted in favor of the proposal are hoping to implement the new rules within 12-18 months, according to Peirce, adding that it was an ""aggressive timeline"" given the changes being proposed",business,73
74,Sam Bankman-Fried may no longer be allowed to play League of Legends,Cointelegraph By   Luke Huigsloot,2023-02-16 01:44:56,"Sam Bankman-Fried, the former CEO of crypto exchange FTX, may no longer be able to play League of Legends and other video games if newly proposed changes to his bail conditions from United States prosecutors are approved. In a Feb. 15 letter to United States District Judge Lewis Kaplan, U.S. Attorney Damian Williams asked the court to further expand restrictions surrounding Bankman-Fried’s electronic device usage. They pointed to Bankman-Fried’s recent device usage as cause for concern, and agreed with the court’s intuition that it was “shortsighted” to focus only on restricting the use of apps, adding: The prosecutors propose that Bankman-Fried should be prohibited from using cellphones, tablets, computers, or the internet, except for very limited uses such as reviewing pre-trial evidence, communicating with lawyers and accessing emails. Here’s the list of proposed new bail restrictions that SBF is going completely ignore, without any real consequences https://t.co/cMVCdmRAj3 He would be restricted to using a single computer and cell phone, which in addition to his Gmail account would be monitored using a “pen register” — a device or process that essentially produces a list of phone numbers of internet addresses contacted from a specific source. Bankman-Fried is understood to be an avid gamer, having reportedly played online video games such as League of Legends during fundraising rounds while at FTX. Bankman-Fried also mentioned during an interview with New York Times on Nov. 13 that he likes to play games , as it helps him “unwind a bit” and clear his mind. Under the newly proposed bail conditions, it appears that Bankman-Fried will no longer be allowed to partake in the activity. Related: Judge allows release of identities of guarantors behind Sam Bankman-Fried’s bail Earlier this month, the former CEO was prohibited from using encrypted messaging apps after he was found to have contacted potential witnesses in his criminal case. He has also been temporarily banned from using VPNs on Feb. 14, after the Justice Department discovered he had used a VPN on two different occasions — in order to watch sports coverage. This ban will be further discussed during a Feb. 16 hearing. Many from the crypto community were disgusted by the initial conditions of Bankman-Fried’s bail, which required him to wear an ankle bracelet but afforded him full computer and internet access from his parents luxurious home in sunny California. SBF will be spending Christmas at home with his parents playing video games rather than locked up in a cell. What kind of justice is that?",business,74

The decision comes after judge John Dorsey postponed the ruling last week, citing concerns that the examiner could cost creditors tens of millions of dollars. The U.S. Trustee’s Argument for an Independent Examiner Ultimately Overruled by the Court’s Authority In the latest filing in the FTX bankruptcy case docket, judge John Dorsey has denied the appointment of an independent examiner. Dorsey stated that the current team, led by FTX CEO John J. Ray III, is “highly qualified” to handle the bankruptcy proceedings independently. The decision overrides the U.S. Trustee’s request to hire an independent examiner, which was said to be mandated by Congress. The judge presiding over the FTX bankruptcy case stressed, however, that he had “no doubt that appointing an examiner would not be in the best interest of the creditors.” According to estimates, current management claimed that expenses for an independent examiner could reach between $90 million and $100 million. “Every dollar spent on administrative expenses in these cases is $1 less for the creditors,” Dorsey stated during the hearing, agreeing that an examiner could be very costly. Since Dec. 1, 2022, an attorney for the U.S. Trustee, an arm of the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), has been attempting to appoint an examiner to the FTX case in the Delaware bankruptcy court. During the case, a representative for the Trustee argued that the appointment of an independent examiner was mandated by Congress and no longer within Dorsey’s authority. The Trustee’s argument was supported by a letter from four bipartisan U.S. senators insisting that an independent examiner be appointed. However, the decision by the Delaware bankruptcy judge emphasizes that his court’s authority has overruled the government’s request. What are your thoughts on the judge’s decision to deny the U.S. Trustee’s request for an independent examiner in the FTX bankruptcy case? Let us know in the comments section below.",business,80

84,"The SEC shook Kraken down for $30M, but it doesn't mean they had a case",Cointelegraph By  Ari Good,2023-02-15 22:05:17,"The settlement between Kraken (Payward Ventures) and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission set off alarm bells in the crypto community this month. Apparently, Kraken — one of the most compliance-minded crypto exchanges in existence — decided to buy its peace rather than fight with the SEC for years over whether it was offering unregistered “securities” through its staking program. The nature of the settlement is that Kraken neither admitted nor denied the SEC’s allegations, and the existence of the settlement, technically speaking, cannot be used as legal precedent for any argument either side of the issue might present. That said, the settlement matters, as it will clearly chill crypto staking in the United States. As SEC Chairman Gary Gensler said, “Whether it’s through staking-as-a-service, lending, or other means, crypto intermediaries, when offering investment contracts in exchange for investors’ tokens, need to provide the proper disclosures and safeguards required by our securities laws.” Gensler casts a wide net, indeed, for what the SEC considers to be “investment contracts,” and running staking out of business was perhaps precisely what he had in mind. Related: Expect the SEC to use its Kraken playbook against staking protocols That the SEC was successful in pressuring Kraken out of $30 million does not, however, make the agency’s position legally or logically correct. As a preliminary matter, “staking” and “lending” are totally different things. Staking is the process by which one pledges one’s coins or tokens to a proof-of-stake blockchain, either directly or by delegating one’s coins to a third party, for the purpose of securing the network. Stakers are the ones through whom the blockchain’s consensus mechanism operates, as they “vote” on which blocks will be added to the chain. The process is algorithmic, and the reward is automatic when one’s position is electronically “selected” as the validator for a given block. Settlements are not law. They're a decision that the economics of settling are better than fighting, no more. The SEC thinks staking-as-a-service is a security. Kraken didn't admit or deny either way. It may be a tough question, but the SEC hasn't answered it either way today. Stakers don’t necessarily know who the other stakers are, nor do they need to know, as the fate of one’s stake is dependent only on following the rules of that blockchain as to “liveness” (availability) and other technical considerations. There are risks of “slashing” (losing your coins) for bad behavior or unavailability, but again, these are algorithmic remedies doled out automatically according to transparent rules built into the code. Put simply, in staking, it’s between you and the blockchain, not you and the intermediary. Lending, in contrast, invokes the entrepreneurial and managerial skill (or lack thereof) of the people to whom you lend. This is a distinctly human enterprise. One does not necessarily know what the borrower is doing with the money; one simply hopes to get it back with a return. This counterparty risk is in part what the securities laws are intended to address. In lending, the relationship is between the lender and the borrower, a relationship that can take all kinds of unexpected turns. Related: Kraken staking ban is another nail in crypto’s coffin — And that’s a good thing The reasons staking arrangements are not “investment contracts” (and thereby “securities”) were stated eloquently by Coinbase chief legal officer Paul Grewal in a blog post. Put simply, merely serving as an intermediary does not render the underlying economic relationship an “investment contract.” Yet the SEC here does not seem to want to entertain the differences between service providers and counterparties. It is true that third parties, such as Kraken, serve a custodial role in the staking relationship — that is, they may hold the private keys to the particular coins the client intended to stake. However, serving as a custodian of a fungible asset, especially where such a custodian holds collateral on a 1:1 basis to back every customer account, is a discreet service. There is nothing to suggest that Kraken, Coinbase or any other staking-as-a-service provider, otherwise uses human judgment, intuition, grit or any other hallmark of one’s entrepreneurial or managerial ability, to advance or inhibit the staker’s purpose. One’s reward does not improve or decline based on how the intermediary performs. There should be (and are) rules and regulations for how custodians function, but possession does not, by itself, a security make.

In a Feb. 15 announcement, Tuberville said the Financial Freedom Act — which he first introduced to the U.S. Senate in May 2022 — aimed to reverse policy from the Department of Labor directing what type of investments were allowed in 401(k) plans, including crypto. According to the senator, the bill would bar the DOL from pursuing enforcement actions for individuals “using brokerage windows to invest in cryptocurrency.” “The federal government shouldn’t choose winners and losers in the investment game,” said Tuberville. “My bill ensures that everyone who earns a paycheck has the financial freedom to invest in their futures however they see fit.” Sen.

Lummis said in a December 2022 interview — following the crypto market crash and the bankruptcies of major firms including FTX, Voyager Digital and Celsius Network — that she was “very comfortable” with having U.S. investors include Bitcoin ( BTC ) in their retirement accounts. Politico reported on Feb. 14 that Florida Representative Byron Donalds planned to introduce an equivalent bill in the House of Representatives on Feb. 17. Donalds and Tuberville, both members of the Republican party, could face opposition from across the aisle — Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren has previously expressed concerns about Fidelity Investments’ plans to include BTC in 401(k) accounts.

Since the inscriptions trend has swelled, a number of individuals and organizations have been building infrastructure to promote more adoption. For instance, gamma.io and ordinalsbot.com have created tools that allow people to mint Ordinal inscriptions onchain for an added fee on top of the network fee. Tools such as these have appeared in more recent times and are allowing users who do not operate a full node to mint inscriptions.

This initiative is part of Abu Dhabi's efforts to attract and support innovative businesses and to establish the UAE as a leader in the Web3 space. Ahmad Ali Alwan, the deputy CEO of Hub71, said he sees the launch of Hub71+ Digital Assets as a symbol of Abu Dhabi’s willingness to embrace “disruptive businesses that drive change and transformation on a global scale.” By partnering with ADGM, FAB, and FABRIC, as well as prominent Web3 firms and facilitators, startups can safely fund, develop, and market innovative concepts while operating within the largest MENA region’s regulated virtual asset jurisdiction. This collaboration offers an opportunity for startups to thrive while catalyzing change and growth.

102,"Price analysis 2/15: BTC, ETH, BNB, XRP, ADA, DOGE, MATIC, SOL, DOT, LTC",Cointelegraph By Rakesh Upadhyay,2023-02-15 20:10:00,"Bitcoin ( BTC ) is leading the cryptocurrency markets on the path to recovery. Although the United States Consumer Price Index (CPI) print for January was marginally higher than expectations , it did not dent the enthusiasm of bullish crypto traders. A positive response to seemingly negative data is a sign that the sentiment is bullish and traders are looking for buying opportunities. However, some analysts are cautious due to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY). They believe that a sustained rally in the DXY could limit the upside in cryptocurrencies. Usually, long-term downtrends are followed by a base formation. During this phase, several analysts remain skeptical about a rally, but the price action continues to surprise them. Although data is important, short-term traders should focus more on price action and devise a suitable strategy. What are the critical levels to keep an eye on? Let’s study the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out. Bitcoin ( BTC ) bounced off the $21,480 level on Feb. 14 and reached the 20-day exponential moving average ($22,235). This shows that buyers are trying to arrest the correction near the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of $21,228. A shallow pullback is an indication that traders are buying on minor dips. If bears want to strengthen their position, they will have to aggressively defend the $22,800 level and sink the price below $21,228. If they do that, the BTC/USDT pair may extend the correction to the 50% retracement level at $20,294. The deeper the correction, the longer it is likely to take for the next leg of the up-move to begin. Conversely, if bulls drive and sustain the price above $22,800, the pair could rally to $23,500 and then to $24,255. The bears are expected to fiercely guard this zone. If the price turns down from it, the pair may remain range-bound between $21,228 and $24,255 for a few days. Ether ( ETH ) continues to trade between the moving averages. The strong rebound off the 50-day simple moving average ($1,483) on Feb. 14 displays demand at lower levels. The flattening 20-day EMA ($1,569) and the RSI near the midpoint suggest a balance between supply and demand. A break above the 20-day EMA will tilt the advantage in favor of the buyers. The ETH/USDT pair could then retest the solid overhead resistance at $1,680. On the contrary, if the price turns down from the current level and plummets below the 50-day simple moving average (SMA), it will signal an advantage to bears. That may start a deeper correction to the next strong support at $1,352. BNB ( BNB ) plunged below the 50-day SMA ($293) on Feb. 13, but the bears could not build upon this advantage. The long tail on the day’s candlestick shows strong buying near $280. The 20-day EMA has started to turn down, and the RSI is in the negative territory, indicating that bears have a slight edge. The next drop to $280 increases the risk of a breakdown. Below this support, the BNB/USDT pair could extend its decline to $260. If the price turns up from the current level and rises above the 20-day EMA, it will indicate solid demand at lower levels. That could enhance the prospects of a rally to the neckline of the bullish inverted head-and-shoulders (H&S) pattern. XRP ( XRP ) jumped up from the strong support at $0.36 on Feb. 14 and reached the 50-day SMA ($0.38). The bears are likely to sell the relief rally to the moving averages. If the price turns down from the current level, it will suggest that bears are selling on rallies. That may result in a retest of the support at $0.36. This is an important level for the bulls to defend because if it cracks, the XRP/USDT pair will form a head-and-shoulders pattern. This bearish setup has a target objective of $0.29. Alternatively, if the price rises above the moving averages, it will indicate that the pair may oscillate between $0.42 and $0.36 for a while longer. Cardano’s ADA ( ADA ) attracted solid buying at the 50-day SMA ($0.34), as seen from the long tail on the Feb. 13 candlestick. The bulls followed it up with another strong up-move on Feb. 14 that rose above the 20-day EMA ($0.38). If the price sustains above the 20-day EMA, the bulls will try to propel the ADA/USDT pair above the neckline of the inverse head-and-shoulders pattern. If they succeed, the pair could pick up momentum and soar above the immediate resistance at $0.44. The next major hurdle is $0.52, and if this is crossed, the rally may extend to the pattern target of $0.60. Contrarily, if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that bears are trying a comeback. They will have to sink the price below $0.34 to gain the upper hand. Repeated attempts by the bears to sustain Dogecoin ( DOGE ) below the 50-day SMA ($0.08) have failed in the past few days. This shows strong demand at lower levels. The bulls will now try to sustain the price above the 20-day EMA ($0.08). If they manage to do that, the DOGE/USDT pair could rise to the overhead resistance zone between $0.10 and $0.11. The bears are expected to defend this zone with all their might. Another possibility is that the price turns down from the 20-day EMA. If that happens, it will suggest that the bears are trying to flip the 20-day EMA into resistance. The pair could then fall to the 50-day SMA and eventually to the strong support at $0.07. The bears pulled Polygon’s MATIC ( MATIC ) below the 20-day EMA ($1.19) on Feb. 13 and Feb. 14, but they could not sustain the lower levels. This shows that the bulls are not willing to give up their advantage. If bulls thrust the price above the downtrend line, the MATIC/USDT pair could attempt a rally to $1.35. Such a move will enhance the prospects of the continuation of the up-move. If $1.35 is scaled, the rally may extend to $1.75. Instead, if the price turns down sharply from the downtrend line, it will suggest that bears are selling on every minor rally. The next dip below the 20-day EMA may open the gates for a possible slide to $1.05. Related: 3 reasons why Binance’s BNB token risks sliding further by March Solana’s SOL ( SOL ) has been stuck between the moving averages since Feb. 9, which suggests indecision among the bulls and the bears. The flattish 20-day EMA ($22.21) and the RSI at the midpoint also do not give a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears. This indicates that the SOL/USDT pair may swing between the downtrend line and the 50-day SMA for some time. If the price breaks below the 50-day SMA, the selling may intensify, and the pair is likely to slump to $15. Conversely, if bulls kick the price above the downtrend line, the pair could complete a 100% retracement and rise to $39. The bears tried to pull Polkadot’s DOT ( DOT ) below the 50-day SMA ($5.76) on Feb. 13 and Feb. 14, but the long tail on the candlestick shows strong buying at lower levels. The bulls will try to build upon this advantage and thrust the price above the 20-day EMA ($6.32). If they can pull it off, the DOT/USDT pair could start its journey toward the overhead resistance at $7.25. This will form an inverse H&S pattern, which will complete on a break above $7.25. This reversal setup has a pattern target of $10.28. Instead, if the price turns down and breaks below the 50-day SMA, it will suggest that bears have flipped the 20-day EMA into resistance. That could start a deeper correction to $4.35. The long tail on Litecoin’s ( LTC ) Feb. 13 candlestick shows that the bulls are buying the dips to the 50-day SMA ($86). Buyers continued their purchase on Feb. 14 and cleared the 20-day EMA ($93) hurdle. The price is stuck between $102.53 on the upside and $88 on the downside. The flattish 20-day EMA and the RSI above 57 point to a possible range-bound action in the near term. A consolidation near the local highs is a positive sign, as it suggests that stronger hands continue to hold on to their position as they anticipate the up-move to resume. A break above $102.53 could clear the path for a possible rise to $115. This positive view could be negated in the near term if the price turns down and plummets below $88. The pair may then tumble to $81 and later to $75.

108,Getting Back The Missing Stimulus Check: States Continue To Send Out Inflation Relief Payments In 2023,Md Shahnawaz,2023-02-15 19:58:13,"Economy Stimulus Check Top Stories Getting Back The Missing Stimulus Check: States Continue To Send Out Inflation Relief Payments In 2023 By Md Shahnawaz - February 15, 2023 Millions of Americans missed out on their federal stimulus checks and other relief measures initiated by the government as a response to the economic hardship caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. But it may not be too late to claim any of the missed stimulus checks. The main reason individuals and households missed out on the stimulus check is due to their absence in the records of the IRS or due to non-filing of their federal income tax returns for the past 2–3 years. But for many, merely filing their 2020 income tax returns should get them their first and second stimulus check, and filing their 2021 income tax returns will get them their third stimulus check. Individuals who missed out on any of the federal stimulus checks will have to wait for the 2023 income tax season to begin. They will get help with filing their 2020 or 2021 income tax return. They may also claim their missing stimulus check through GetYourRefund.org, which opened on January 31, 2023 . Claiming The Recovery Rebate Credit On The Tax Return Individuals and families may get the Recovery Rebate Credit by filing their previous income tax returns. The returns that they need to file depend on the stimulus check they have missed. For the initial two stimulus checks given out under the CARES Act for the first stimulus check and the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2021 for the second payment, they have the free filing option through the GetYourRefund.org site. For the third stimulus check that is part of the American Rescue Plan Act of March 2021, individuals and joint filers have the chance to avail of free filing through GetCTC.org for a combination of missing stimulus checks, claimants have to file through the GetYourRefund.org site. For the first and the second stimulus check, claimants had to file a tax return for the 2020 tax year, which was in 2021. The deadline to file the returns was May 17, 2021, while the tax filing extension deadline was on October 15, 2021. For those who missed out on the filing deadline, there is still the option to file their income tax return to collect their first and second stimulus checks. For those who do not owe taxes, there is no penalty for filing late. Those owing taxes may be subject to penalties and fines for not filing or not paying their taxes. The tax authorities may also reduce their tax refund to pay for any taxes that they owe as federal and state government debts. Further details about the options open for those who may owe taxes may be obtained by visiting the IRS site and going through the ‘Filing Past Due Tax Returns’ or the ‘What to do if I Owe Taxes but Can’t Pay Them’ part. For the third stimulus check, filers need to file their income tax return for the 2021 tax year which they were scheduled to file in 2022. The deadline for filing the returns was April 18, 2022, while the tax filing extension deadline was on October 17, 2022. The IRS also sent out letters to around 10 million residents who missed out on their stimulus check payments mainly due to their records being absent in the data of the IRS and the treasury department. States Continue To Send Out Payments From 2022 Around 21 states have sent out relief payments in 2022 to residents to combat inflation that reached record figures, the highest in more than 40 years. For those who missed out on the payments, there are ways they can recover the amount . Over 50M Americans received some form of stimulus check or tax refund as state government stepped in to help out residents to tide over rising prices. This unprecedented inflation adversely affected the prices of every product and good from gasoline to groceries. But as with the federal stimulus checks or the economic impact payments, many residents missed out on the state inflation relief payments. But there are ways that individuals and joint filers can still claim any missing stimulus checks. While some might not qualify under the conditions stipulated by the state administration, others might have missed out on the payments because the state tax agency might not have their present address or their banking details. There is also the possibility that their income tax returns for 2021 , to be filed in 2022, were not filed correctly. You would first need to find out if your state issued a stimulus check and whether you ticked all the qualification boxes to get the stimulus check. You would then need to inquire about any missing inflation rebate payments. While the state stimulus checks were mostly paid out by the states in the first and the second quarter of 2022, some states planned their inflation relief payments for the last quarter, coinciding with the festive season. Alaska was among the first states to declare payments to residents. But the Dept. of Revenue of the state only began issuing the payments on September 20 last year. Most Alaskans received a Permanent Fund Dividend that allowed them a part of the oil and other mineral revenues. Last year, soaring international oil prices allowed the state to send their residents a generous $650 as an energy relief payment. The PFD stimulus check amount for 2022 has seen a huge leap and has touched $3,284 in 2022, which is a 195% increase from the previous year. California had earlier issued two rounds of payments under the Golden State Stimulus Checks I and II. Governor Gavin Newsom decided to send out gas and transit cards worth $400 to individuals and families if they had a vehicle registered in the Golden State. The plan was changed to a third round of stimulus checks for 23M residents of California. Single filers with an Adjusted Gross Income below $250,000 and joint filers with an AGI below $500,000 received a Middle-Class Tax Refund ( MCTR ) worth between $200 and $1,050 depending on their AGI. Joint filers with a state AGI of $150,000 or less for 2021 received the maximum amount of $1,050 if they declared a dependent in their state returns for 2021. The highest individual tax refund amount is $350. Those who did not receive their payment should call up the Franchise Tax Board at 800-542-9332.

111,Judge allows release of identities of guarantors behind Sam Bankman-Fried’s bail,Cointelegraph By Turner Wright,2023-02-15 19:41:53,"A federal judge has allowed the identities of guarantors who signed on as sureties for former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried’s $250 million bond to be made public following a request from several news outlets. Court documents released on Feb. 15 show that the two previously unidentified individuals are Andreas Paepcke, a senior research scientist at Stanford University, and Larry Kramer, a former dean of Stanford Law School. The two signed on as sureties for Bankman-Fried’s bail on Jan. 25 for $200,000 and $500,000, respectively. Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried — SBF’s parents — were the other two parties who signed off on their son’s bond in December 2022 following his arraignment. The two were law professors at Stanford prior to their son’s arrest, with Bankman seemingly becoming more of a target in FTX’s bankruptcy case — company debtors issued subpoenas to him , his son, and other “insiders” on Feb. 14. According to a Feb. 15 report from Business Insider, Kramer said he had been friends with Bankman and Fried since the 1990s, and his $500,000 contribution was based on that relationship. It’s unclear at the time of publication what connection Paepcke may have to Bankman-Fried or his parents. Bankman-Fried’s bail conditions restricted him to home arrest at his parent’s California house, but he has been permitted to leave for court appearances and other allowances. Judge Lewis Kaplan has amended SBF’s bail conditions to include restrictions on accessing certain messaging apps, using virtual private networks, and contacting current and former FTX and Alameda Research employees. Eight major news outlets petitioned Judge Kaplan in a Jan. 12 letter, requesting the court disclose the names of the two individuals “that provided Mr. Bankman-Fried with financial backing.” The judge initially granted the petition but stayed the release of the guarantors’ identities until Feb. 7 to allow time for SBF’s legal team to appeal. Bankman-Fried’s lawyers argued against the release of Paepcke’s and Kramer’s identities — who were at the time unnamed — in a Jan. 3 letter, saying that Bankman and Fried had been the target of “intense media scrutiny, harassment, and threats.” The legal team announced their intent to appeal Kaplan’s decision, which delayed the release of the information until Feb. 14. Related: FTX fallout: SBF trial could set precedent for the crypto industry SBF’s criminal trial is scheduled to begin in October, while FTX’s bankruptcy case is ongoing.

113,Napster Expands Into Web3 Music Space With Acquisition of Mint Songs,Jamie Redman,2023-02-15 19:30:36,"On Wednesday, Napster, the music streaming service originally launched in 1999, announced that the company has finalized a deal to acquire the Web3 music startup Mint Songs. Napster’s CEO, Jon Vlassopulos, insists that “we are in an unprecedented era of innovation in the digital music space,” and he believes Web3 innovations can help musicians find new ways to connect with their fans. Napster Ventures Sets Its Sights on Web3 Music Startups After its Hivemind and Algorand acquisition in May 2022, Napster has reignited its focus on the Web3 space by purchasing Mint Songs, a Web3 music startup. The startup had previously raised $4.3 million from firms including Freestyle Capital and Castle Island Ventures. The Mint Songs platform gives musicians the ability to mint non-fungible token (NFT) items and songs via the Polygon and Ethereum blockchains. Mint Songs has worked with artists such as Gramatik, Black Dave, and Mark de Clive-Lowe to release exclusive non-fungible token (NFT) memorabilia. When Napster’s CEO, Jon Vlassopulos, joined the company last year, he revealed plans to acquire companies in the music and Web3 space. Napster announced on Wednesday that the acquisition of Mint Songs is the first of many with a focus on Web3 features and related services. “We are in an unprecedented era of innovation in the digital music space and it feels like there have been more music startups formed in the last two to three years than in the previous 20,” Napster CEO Jon Vlassopulos said in a statement sent to Bitcoin.com News. “We are delighted to welcome one of the most impressive Web3 music startups, Mint Songs, as the newest member of the Napster family,” Vlassopulos added. The exact value of the Mint Songs acquisition was not disclosed by Napster, and the deal was executed by Napster Ventures, a newly created subsidiary that aims to invest in the best Web3 music startups going forward. “We are excited for Napster to be a central player in the music Web3 ecosystem, and acquiring Mint Songs is a great foundational step,” said Matt Zhang, founder and managing partner of Hivemind, in a statement. Napster believes that combining Web3 with existing streaming distribution will “unlock new creative and commercial opportunities” for music fans. Similarly, the ‘old-school’ music file-sharing service, Limewire, has also attempted to tackle the Web3 space with NFTs. What do you think the Napster acquisition of Mint Songs means for the future of music in the Web3 space? Let us know your thoughts about this subject in the comments section below.",business,113
114,EC launches blockchain regulatory sandbox for 20 projects annually through 2026,Cointelegraph By   Derek Andersen,2023-02-15 19:30:00,"The European Commission announced the launch of the European Blockchain Regulatory Sandbox on Feb. 15. The sandbox will provide a space for regulatory dialog for 20 projects per year through 2026. The sandbox was first announced in 2020 and is being facilitated by a number of private firms that won tenders in 2022 . Funding will come from the Digital Europe Programme. Projects will be chosen by an independent panel of academic experts on a competitive basis from public and private sector use cases of “Blockchain and other Distributed Ledger Technologies.” Public sector projects on the European Blockchain Services Infrastructure (EBSI) will be considered among the applicants. The EBSI is a pan-European blockchain run by a partnership of the EU countries with Norway and Lichtenstein. Members of the annual sandbox cohort will be matched with national and European Union regulators to receive confidential legal advice and regulatory guidance, while regulators will have the opportunity to acquaint themselves with new blockchain technology. The application deadline for the first cohort of projects is April 14. Projects must have a proof of concept validated according to specifications and have a cross-border dimension. With our consulting arm OXYGY, today we announce, together with the @EU_Commission , that applications are now open for the first cohort of the European blockchain regulatory sandbox for blockchain/DLT innovators @EuropeanSandbox : #blockchain #sandbox https://t.co/ZNbjUCTubp pic.twitter.com/PtdS0oBS8p Projects already chosen by public officials for deployment will have priority. Companies should be based in the European Economic Area (EEA). Those companies operate in consortium with companies outside of the EEA, as long as the beneficiary of the project is the EEA-based company. Participants will not be reimbursed for their expenses. Projects selected will receive a written legal assessment followed by two virtual meetings with participating regulators. The EBSI Early Adopters incubator program is also accepting applications for its third cohort. A similar sandbox program was proposed in United States Representative Patrick McHenry’s Financial Services Innovation bill. The United Kingdom may also get a comparable sandbox program in the next round of its financial services reforms.",business,114

According to the CREA, on an annual basis, sales dropped 37.1 per cent nationwide in the first month of the year compared with January 2022 — noted by the CREA as the second-best January ever. “The big question on everyone’s minds after last year was what will housing markets do in 2023?” said CREA Chair Jill Oudil. “We may have to wait another month or two to see what buyers are planning this year since new listings are currently trickling out at near-record low levels, but that should change as the weather warms. When looking for information and guidance about how to buy or sell a property, your best bet is to contact a local Realtor.” Related articles: Calls grow for changes to mortgage stress test in Canada Canadian home prices fall year over year, first decline since end of 2008: report BC home sales expected to cool down in 2023: BCREA Month-over-month, the CREA says national home sales declined three per cent this January. In terms of stock, the association notes the number of newly listed homes rose slightly by 3.3 per cent on a monthly basis to start the year, with increases in B.C. leading the way. However, the CREA says new listings “remain historically low,” with new supply hitting the lowest level for January this year since 2000. Meanwhile, as home sales dropped, so too did the average sale price, by 18.3 per cent. The actual average price in January sat at $612,204, down from $749,437 during the same month last year, the CREA says. On a seasonally adjusted basis, the average price in January was $620,605, down 1.8 per cent from December. -With files from The Canadian Press",business,118
119,"SEC enforcement action creates a silver lining for GMX, Lido (LDO) and Maker (MKR) price",Cointelegraph By  Kyle White,2023-02-15 19:02:56,"The United States Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) has started ramping up its crackdown on the crypto industry and recent enforcement actions had a negative impact on crypto prices last week and at the start of this week. The SEC is focusing on stablecoin issuers. The most recent SEC stablecoin crackdown was on Feb. 13 through the issuance of a Wells notice to Paxos Trust Company, the issuer of Binance USD ( BUSD ). While Paxos says that BUSD is not a security and thus outside the SEC’s jurisdiction, some lawyers say the answer is not so simple, which creates fear that other top stablecoin issuers like Circle’s USD Coin ( USDC ) could be next. The SEC is also putting crosshairs on centralized exchanges ( CEX ) by questioning how they can use customer funds as qualified custodians. On Feb. 15, a five-member SEC panel will vote on whether to make it more difficult for crypto firms to hold digital assets. Centralized staking platforms have also come under the SEC’s microscope and because staking programs provide investors with yield, the SEC believes these offerings are securities. On Feb. 9 the SEC began its assault on these programs by reaching a $30 million settlement over Kraken’s earn program . Interestingly, traders have not adopted a fully risk-off position to the recent SEC activity, and certain decentralized solutions like GMX (GMX), Lido (LDO) and Maker ( MKR ) are soaring. Let’s take a closer look at what’s with decentralized service providers. After the Wells Notice was sent to Paxos by the SEC, BUSD redemptions surged to $342 million in 24 hours. Redemptions from BUSD to Paxos burn the outstanding debt token. So while Binance said they continue to support BUSD, its market cap will decrease over time with Paxos barred from minting new tokens. While the drawdown has slowed, the BUSD market cap has dropped from $16.2 billion before the Feb. 13 SEC announcement to $15.4 billion on Feb. 14. The $15.4 billion market cap marks a monthly low for the third largest stablecoin. On the heels of the SEC’s enforcement action, Maker — the issuer of the decentralized stablecoin DAI — has seen an increase in usage and fees. Over a seven-day period, Maker fees have increased 8.37% and skyrocketed on Feb. 13 to $667,000 in 24 hours. Maker is the top 10 performing token on CoinGecko when sorted by percentage returns, gaining over 8.8% in seven days. With the uncertainty surrounding other large stablecoins like USDC after the SEC’s enforcement announcement, Maker’s fees could continue to increase. GMX, the native token of the GMX decentralized derivatives exchange, has previously benefited when a major centralized exchange saw high outflows. GMX tends to see a boost in fees and its token price . As Binance net outflows reached $788 million in the 24 hours after the Feb. 13 SEC announcement, GMX price rose to a new all-time high of $83.02. On Feb. 15, Binance saw another $535 million in net outflows. On Feb. 10, GMX hit its all-time high of fees received, reaching $5.7 million. And with the daily active users increasing 16.2% to 2,150, the outflow from Binance may lead to sustained growth for the budding exchange. Investors seem to be betting on GMX’s growth, making it the ninth top token on Feb. 14 by returns in seven days, gaining 12.9%. After the SEC’s $30 million settlement with Kraken, BTC and altcoin prices dropped, while LDO price surged. Within 24 hours of the Feb. 9 SEC announcement, LDO gained 13.2% and investors seem to believe that Lido can repeat this action as it is a top twelve performing token with 16% seven-day gains. In addition to price growth, Lido’s usage as a decentralized staking platform has skyrocketed, seeing $35.8 million in 30-day fees. While Lido has not witnessed an increase in average daily active users, the potential for future enforcement actions against Coinbase might translate to an increase in Lido’s market share among Ether stakers. What is clear is that the string of recent SEC crackdowns on centralized staking, centralized exchanges and stablecoins are leading investors to position themselves in decentralized solutions like GMX, Lido and Maker.

Zipmex announced on Feb. 15 that creditors have until Feb. 21 to vote on the scheme, which is being managed by KordaMentha. They “will receive 100% of their digital assets in the Z Wallet” if the scheme is approved and the cryptocurrency closes its pending investment deal. Last July, Zipmex filed for debt relief in Singapore after its counter-party, crypto lending firm Babel Finance, halted withdrawals, citing “unusual liquidity pressures.” The exchange was also impacted by the bankruptcy of crypto lending firm Celsius. Together, the two counterparties owe Zipmex $48 million and $5 million , respectively. Zipmex subsequently paused withdrawals on its platform after the revelations last July. However, withdrawals were resumed within two days for its fiat currency and trading funds service Trade Wallet. That said, the firm’s Z Wallet, used for Zipmex services and receipt of earnings and bonuses, remains in the debt moratorium state with the gradual resumption of withdrawals . Cointelegraph reported on Dec. 2 that Thai Venture Capital V Ventures will acquire Zipmex for $100 million in cash and crypto. According to court documents, Zipmex plans to use cryptocurrency assets received from the transaction to unlock frozen customer accounts on the exchange by April. Subsequent to thisdevelopment, on Jan. 11, the Securities and Exchange Commission of Thailand began a new probe of Zipmex, alleging a breach of local rules. The regulatory agency has also warned investors to carefully review documents issued by the company before making a deal.",business,123

She has no significant crypto holdings. Follow @ cheyenneligon on Twitter A federal judge ruled the names of Sam Bankman-Fried's bond co-signers should be revealed after Bankman-Fried did not apply to the appeals court. District Judge Lewis Kaplan, of the Southern District of New York, originally ruled in favor of news organizations, including CoinDesk, which argued the names of Bankman-Fried's signers were of public interest, but stated the ruling pending an appeal. While Bankman-Fried's attorneys filed a notice that they would appeal, they did not file the actual appeal, the judge said in a new ruling Wednesday. The signers were revealed to be Stanford University's Andreas Paepcke and Larry Kramer , who put up $200,000 and $500,000, respectively. Bankman-Fried's parents are both Stanford instructors. Paepcke is a senior research scientist while Kramer is a former dean of Stanford Law School. Kramer told CoinDesk it was his friendship with Bankman-Fried's parents, Barbara Fried and Joseph Bankman, that led him to post bail for the now-disgraced former FTX CEO. ""Joe Bankman and Barbara Fried have been close friends of my wife and I since the mid-1990s. During the past two years, while my family faced a harrowing battle with cancer, they have been the truest of friends – bringing food, providing moral support, and frequently stepping in at moment's notice to help. In turn, we have sought to support them as they face their own crisis,"" Kramer said in a statement provided to CoinDesk. ""My actions are in my personal capacity, and I have no business dealings or interest in this matter other than to help our loyal and steadfast friends. Nor do I have any comment or position regarding the substance of the legal matter itself, which is what the trial will be for,"" Kramer added."" Paepcke did not immediately return CoinDesk's request for comment. Bankman-Fried was arrested in December but released on a $250 million bond. His parents signed for the bond, putting their Stanford home up as collateral. The names of the other two signers were initially redacted. UPDATE (Feb. 15, 2023, 18:47 UTC): Adds additional detail.

128,Charges Dropped Against NewsNation Reporter Arrested At Ohio Governor’s Press Conference — Update,tedstew1,2023-02-15 18:20:00,"UPDATE: The attorney general of Ohio dropped charges against NewsNation reporter Evan Lambert , whose arrest last week in East Palestine drew an outcry from the network and journalism groups as an infringement on his First Amendment rights. “My office has reviewed the relevant video and documentary evidence, and is dismissing the charges against Evan Lambert as unsupported by sufficient evidence,” Attorney General Dave Yost said in a statement. “While journalists could conceivably be subject to criminal charges for trespassing in some situations, this incident is not one of them. The reporter was lawfully present at a press conference called by the Governor of the state. His conduct was consistent with the purpose of the event and his role as a reporter.” Related Story Elizabeth Vargas To Anchor Weekday Program For NewsNation Lambert was charged with resisting arrest and criminal trespass, both misdemeanors. Lambert had been doing a live shot in the back of a gymnasium, where Ohio Governor Mike DeWine was giving a press conference on a train derailment. Body cam footage showed Ohio National Guard Adjutant General John Harris getting in an argument, as authorities said that Lambert had been too loud. At one point, Harris pushed Lambert away. Then, officers threatened to arrest Lambert if he did not leave. Video footage showed police putting hand restraints on Lambert as he was pinned to the ground. Lambert posted a statement on Twitter in which he wrote, “I’m still processing what was a traumatic event for me, in the context of a time where we are hyper aware of how frequently some police interactions with people of color can end in much worse circumstances. That is not lost on me.” “At the same time, as a journalist who has spent more than a decade covering crime, courts and more recently federal law enforcement, I have great respect for the officers who do their jobs each day with integrity, civil rights, justice and safety at the core of their mission.” I hope these thoughts come out coherently. @NewsNation @NewsNationComms @NXSTMediaGroup @fcasseseYO pic.twitter.com/BbS4WpHu4l — Evan Lambert (@EvanLambertTV) February 15, 2023 PREVIOUSLY, February 9: NewsNation reporter Evan Lambert was released on Wednesday night after his arrest earlier Wednesday at a press conference being given by Ohio Governor Mike DeWine. He said on air, “I have to be kind of careful about what I say, but as you can see I am out. Most things are on video of the situation, so it is pretty clear to see what happened. I’ll just say this. I’m just trying to do my job.” Lambert had been covering the train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio. Lambert was doing a report in the back of the gymnasium, but was arrested after he was told by local law enforcement to be quiet as DeWine was speaking at the press conference, according to NewsNation. DeWine said that he did not order the arrest and that Lambert should not have been stopped from doing the report. Columbiana County Sheriff Brian McLaughlin told CNN that Lambert was arrested on charges of criminal trespass and resisting arrest. NewsNation said the charges were criminal trespass and disorderly conduct, and Lambert said that the charges were still pending. DeWine told NewsNation on Thursday that he expressed to officials that he thought that Lambert should be released. “I think we would like to see this whole thing go away,” DeWine said. “What I don’t know are all the facts and it is not fair for me, to the police or the reporter involved or to anyone else who was involved to comment on that, because I have not seen the facts.” He added, “I don’t want to see him in jail. I don’t want to see him prosecuted. But for me to say, ‘I know what happened,’ would simply not be the truth.” Video footage of the incident showed Lambert face down on the ground as officers tied his hands. Mike Viqueira, NewsNation’s Washington bureau chief, said in a statement, “Evan handled this unfortunate situation with true professionalism, and we appreciate his commitment as a journalist whose goal is to report stories that are fair and unbiased. On a positive front, I just spoke to Evan a short time ago and he was calm, cool and collected and already talking about his next assignment.” Bruce Brown, executive director of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, said that Lambert’s arrest “is yet another deeply concerning instance of law enforcement violating the First Amendment rights of journalists. It’s unreasonable for law enforcement to prohibit press from reporting at PRESS conference by public officials. In this country, we have constitutional protections that guarantee press freedom, and yet, we repeatedly see law enforcement disregarding these protections.” The Society of Professional Journalists also condemned the arrest. “Journalism is not a crime and we urge East Palestine PD to drop all charges against Mr. Lambert immediately and issue a public apology for his arrest.” PREVIOUSLY: A reporter for NewsNation was arrested on Wednesday as he was covering a press conference being given by Ohio Governor Mike DeWine about the train derailment in East Palestine. Evan Lambert, who is based in Washington, had traveled to Ohio to cover the story and was doing a live report during the press conference, being held in a high school gymnasium, when he was told by local law enforcement to be quiet as DeWine was speaking. He was then taken into custody on charges of disorderly conduct and criminal trespassing, according to the network. At the press conference, DeWine said that he had not authorized the arrest, which NewsNation captured on video. Preston Swigart, the photographer who was with Lambert, said that police had told him to stop talking as he did his live shot. “From their standpoint, he didn’t obey orders when he was told to stop talking,” Swigart said, according to NewsNation. “Gymnasiums are echoey and loud and sound kind of carries, so I’m guessing that they just didn’t like the fact that there was sound competing with the governor speaking, even though it was all the way at the other end of the room.” DeWine’s press secretary, Dan Tierney, said that DeWine did not see the incident because his view was blocked by a bank of cameras, but he did hear a disagreement toward the back of the gymnasium. “Governor DeWine did not request that the reporter stop his live broadcast, nor did he know that the request was being made,” Tierney said via email. DeWine said at the press conference, “It has always been my practice that if I’m doing a press conference, if someone wants to report out there, and they want to be talking back to the people back on channel, whatever, they have every right to do that,” DeWine said. “…If someone was stopped from doing that, or told they could not do that, that was wrong.” According to NewsNation , Lambert has been told that he would be held overnight in Columbiana County Jail.

129,Kansas state lawmakers look to cap crypto political donations at $100,Cointelegraph By Turner Wright,2023-02-15 18:15:55,"Lawmakers in the Kansas House of Representatives have introduced a bill proposing to amend the legislature’s rules on political campaign donations. According to the bill, no person would be allowed to make or accept crypto contributions of more than $100 for any political candidate in the state’s primary or general election. For donations under $100, the receiver would need to “immediately convert” the crypto to U.S. dollars, not use the crypto for expenditures, and not HODL the funds. The proposed bill included provisions that seemed to be aimed at mitigating foreign contributions to elections in Kansas, by requiring personal information from those sending crypto — including “that they are not a foreign national”. Crypto campaign contributors would also have to send the funds through a U.S.-based exchange with certain Know Your Customer requirements. The $100 cap would be based on the “fair market value” of the crypto at the time the contribution was received. Kansas lawmakers first introduced the bill to the House on Jan. 25, later referring the legislation to the Committee on Elections. Kansas Governmental Ethics Commission said in 2017 that cryptocurrency contributions were “too secretive”, specifically referring to Bitcoin ( BTC ). The state of California imposed a ban on political campaign donations in 2018, but changed course in July — whilalso capping contributions at $100.

132,Why zero-knowledge KYC won't work,Cointelegraph By Balazs Nemethi,2023-02-15 18:04:36,"The emergence of blockchain technology presents an opportunity to reexamine and innovate solutions used in our day-to-day life. Blockchains and, broadly speaking, the digital space fuelled by an artificial intelligence revolution urgently need to establish verifiable human identities to ensure trust, accountability and regulatory compliance. There are a variety of emerging technologies, both on- and off-chain, that could serve as the basis for a functioning trust framework. One solution, in particular, is often referred to as the holy grail of verifications — zero-knowledge Know Your Customer (zkKYC) verification. ZK stands for zero-knowledge, a cryptography term used to create cryptographic proofs without revealing the underlying confidential information. Z-based solutions are pioneering privacy across the web. The blockchain industry fueled the innovation of ZK technologies due to their minimal transaction size and privacy-preserving nature. Related: Kraken staking ban is another nail in crypto’s coffin — And that’s a good thing Know Your Customer, or KYC, is a set of processes and procedures businesses use to verify their customers’ identities. It is also used in the financial sector to assess any potential risks for money laundering or terrorism financing. It is a requirement for businesses to diligently understand their customers before establishing a relationship with them. Zero-knowledge proofs, when created, are linked to a wallet address through a signature. These proofs are not publicly discoverable by design. Yet when a blockchain address interacts with a public smart contract that requires such a proof, the proof’s existence becomes public, negating the privacy benefits of a zero-knowledge proof. It is due to the design of smart contracts running on public blockchains that create a publicly discoverable list of all interacting wallets. A wallet with zero-knowledge proof that does not interact with an on-chain service that requires such a proof avoids the public disclosure of the proof. Yet this wallet can only transact with another proof-holding wallet following a precursor interaction or the involvement of an intermediary. The hidden nature of these proofs requires both wallets to reveal their proofs to one another proactively. Another issue with zero-knowledge credentials that are prone to change status over time (such as a Know Your Customer good standing) arises from the lack of dynamic updates in available ZK solutions. This absence of continuous status validity necessitates that the wallet holding a zero-knowledge proof will be required to produce a new proof for every on-chain interaction where this proof is required. It is worth noting that emerging blockchain technologies advance zero-knowledge-enabled smart contracts, keeping the interacting wallet address private. However, the issues around the need for dynamic proofs and the inability for verified-to-verified peer-to-peer transactions remain relevant even with these advanced solutions. Projects considering zero-knowledge proofs often contemplate producing these proofs about encrypted data stored on a public ledger. However, it is ill-advised to store any personal information on a public blockchain. Related: A Supreme Court case could kill Facebook and other socials — Allowing blockchain to replace them These eternal ledgers are not designed for personal privacy, and for such use, they are not compliant with privacy regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation and California Consumer Privacy Act. A few significant issues relate to the fact that even encrypted data is considered personally identifiable information. Any such information must be deleted upon request according to these privacy regulations. Because storing personal information on a blockchain furthers non-compliance with privacy regulations, it is not an ideal solution for storing any form of (verified) personal information on-chain. Due to the limitations that each blockchain is limited to information and data available on that given chain, builders in the space must consider other blockchain native mechanisms. Any credential design that provides a form of compliance must avoid privacy violations and ensure that the final infrastructure meets the necessary identity verification and regulatory requirements. Technology advancements far outpace regulatory progress; however, disregarding these rules hinders the technology’s adoption. In addition, when proofs alone are insufficient, and personal information sharing between the participants of a transaction is essential, relying only on off-chain solutions is advised. One example includes decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials. Another option is to employ off-chain zero-knowledge proofs, which provide privacy protection and are suitable for off-chain data verification.

133,Is the SEC Really the Bad Guy?,David Z. Morris,2023-02-15 18:03:43,"David Z. Morris David Z. Morris is CoinDesk's Chief Insights Columnist. He holds Bitcoin, Ethereum, and small amounts of other crypto assets. Follow @ davidzmorris on Twitter They say time moves faster in crypto, and I’m not sure anyone feels that more than we journalists. We’re tasked with keeping track of more or less everything that’s going on, and tuning out for even a few days can leave you feeling so behind there’s no hope of catching up. I’ve been living that relentless reality for months, between untangling the downfall of FTX and launching CoinDesk’s new ”Crypto Crooks” podcast . There wasn’t much “holiday” to my holidays. So I was incredibly grateful to finally take a few days off last week to spend with family and unwind. It turns out that, as the old saying goes, I picked the wrong week to stop sniffing glue . This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here . While I was taking a breather, events unfolded that were exceptional even in crypto terms. The continued ascendance of Ordinal inscriptions on Bitcoin has fascinating and potentially major implications, and in a different moment it would be the most important story going. Instead, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has taken center stage with major enforcement actions that many are interpreting as part of a blunt-force effort to marginalize the entire crypto industry. It continued Wednesday morning with news of proposed new rules that would prevent registered investment advisors (RIA) from engaging with many existing crypto custodial services . After a year in which frauds and charlatans stole or destroyed tens of billions of dollars in investor funds, the SEC has focused much of its crackdown on entities that many crypto veterans would consider “the good guys,” and on services that are far less obviously dangerous than those that ran wild in 2021 and 2022. That reality holds many difficult lessons about the broader pattern of U.S. crypto and financial regulation. That’s especially true of moves against the U.S.-based exchange Kraken, which paid $30 million in an SEC settlement and agreed to shutter its U.S. staking services . For many, the action feels woefully misplaced: Kraken has been a pillar of the crypto ecosystem for a decade and has been a consistently honest actor. The particular tool in question may not have been structured ideally – it seems it was more vulnerable to attack as a “security” because it wasn’t a straight fee-based pass-through for stakers. But the core service being provided was fundamentally valid and useful for the ecosystem, and entirely distinct from the “lending platforms” like Celsius Network and Voyager Digital that blew up last year. The parallel actions against the BUSD stablecoin feel only slightly less misdirected. The SEC reportedly plans to sue Paxos, the issuer of the Binance-branded stablecoin, which the regulator considers an unregistered security . Paxos says it will halt issuance of the token . Binance, the largest offshore crypto exchange, doesn’t have quite the pedigree of Kraken, particularly since it’s a lightly regulated entity. But Binance has been a broadly good actor for half a decade. More to the point, BUSD may be the victim of some fuzziness around the concept of a “stablecoin.” Both regulators and crypto insiders are likely still traumatized by the incredibly violent collapse last spring of terraUSD, a “stablecoin” built on faulty ideas about algorithmic price stabilization . But BUSD is a backed stablecoin, with dollars in a bank guaranteeing redemptions. The obvious read here is that there’s some political expediency at play. These actions come after a year in which the SEC failed to spot or prevent massive frauds – a year in which, in fact, SEC Chief Gary Gensler was seen by some as unusually chummy with one of the biggest fraudsters . Cracking down on Kraken and Paxos is hard not to see as, to some degree, making a show of enforcement on targets of convenience. Dissenting SEC Commissioner Hester Pierce is among those who share that general view . But there’s little point whining about the SEC’s post-facto virtue-signaling – the agency has the power, and seems unlikely to change its stripes any time soon. There’s more alpha in engaging with the realpolitik of its operative logic than in grousing about how unfair it is. That’s especially true because, well, there really was a lot of embarrassing and damaging crypto fraud last year. As Bloomberg’s Matt Levine points out, even the most reasonable counterpoints to misplaced regulation are going to fall on deaf ears once people lose enough money . It’s hard to dispute that the 2021 bubble led investors, builders and the media to feed retail hype and treat a series of con men-like heroes. The whiff of money, as it always seems to, blunted critical faculties and pumped hopium into the vents. So while the SEC’s crackdown is likely to put a lot of misplaced burdens on entities that are substantially blameless, the crypto industry as a whole still needs to look inward and reckon with its own responsibility – and ask how it can better marginalize frauds on the front lines the next time mass crypto-mania returns.

137,Crypto CEOs Need to Accept That Existing Regulations Also Apply to Them,Timothy Cradle,2023-02-15 17:52:00,"Timothy Cradle Timothy Cradle is the director of regulatory affairs at Blockchain Intelligence Group. Brian Armstrong is wrong: Staking is a security and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) just proved it. He just misunderstood their position. This is where the lack of understanding of regulations on the crypto side is starting to get concerning. If we saw the same level of ignorance of the law in banking board rooms as we’ve seen with crypto executives, we would be excused for withdrawing most of our money and putting it in a safe. The Coinbase CEO’s preemptive reaction to the SEC action against rival exchange Kraken's crypto staking shows both a lack of knowledge about what a security is as well as a lack of basic knowledge about when securities laws apply and when they do not. It’s time for crypto executives to stop grandstanding and start getting better, unbiased legal advice. Timothy Cradle is the director of regulatory affairs at Blockchain Intelligence Group. Based on the responses from Armstrong and other crypto executives and decision-makers regarding regulations, it is clear many of them do not seem to understand that they are providing regulated services in a non-compliant manner. In the specific case to which Armstrong reacted before the facts were in, the SEC charged Kraken because it was paying interest on deposit accounts. That is a regulated activity that the SEC provides certain exemptions for, e.g., banks don’t have to register with the commission to pay interest on a savings account; it is certainly not the case that crypto companies are exempted from registering for paying interest to depositors just because the deposits are in crypto, as Brian Armstrong seems to assume. Not only is that not the case, but this is also not the first time the SEC has successfully made this case in the form of an enforcement action. In 2022 BlockFI was fined for providing a similar service – paying interest on deposits – without registering with the commission. Coinbase, itself, received a letter from the SEC warning them away from providing a similar service to BlockFI. So why is it the case that Coinbase’s CEO does not seem to remember this and does not think the rules that apply to other financial services apply to his financial service? It is either intentional ignorance or literal ignorance. Both are a concern when the future of a multi-billion-dollar financial services company is at stake. The problem is the pernicious concept in crypto that goes under the name “regulation by enforcement.” We need to excise this phrase from crypto, not just because it is imprecise but because it simply is not a thing. Regulators in the U.S. are not creating new rules; they are enforcing existing rules. Perhaps crypto executives need a quick refresher on the law and rule-making process: 1. A bill is proposed 2. The bill goes to committee 3. A bill is voted on 4. The bill is signed into law 5. Regulators write rules to match the intent of the law 6. A comment period is open to the public (no tweets accepted) 7. A final rule is written and published in the Federal Register There is more nuance to the process, but that is it in a nutshell – it is a multi-year process on average, and that is how regulations are made. Precedent can be set with litigation by the regulators, but again, this action is not rule-making; this is enforcing existing rules. If regulators have thus far been successful in obtaining enforcements then this should be a huge wake-up call to the crypto industry that financial transactions in crypto conform to regulated financial transactions and, as such, the existing rules apply. If their legal counsel is telling them otherwise, then it is time to get new legal counsel because this is a multi-million dollar lesson that the industry keeps learning and will keep learning until they make a change in strategy. A new lawyer won’t cost as much. We’re starting to get a growing list of crypto services where one might ask: Is it regulated? And based on the enforcement actions we can say: Yes, unequivocally. Here are some examples: Staking : Kraken enforcement action 2023 Rewards : BlockFI enforcement action 2021 Lending : Coinbase legal warning from the SEC 2021 Token issuance: Telegram (TON) settlement with the SEC in 2020 Crypto-based derivatives trading: Ooki DAO lawsuit from Commodity Futures Trading Commission 2022 All of these enforcement actions involve regulated activities; and there will be more settlements and enforcement actions to come. Soon we’ll see definitive proof that tokens themselves are unregistered securities when the SEC wins the Ripple case. As if we didn’t already know that via multiple comments from SEC officials. In the year to come we’ll have more concrete proof that certain crypto services are unregistered futures and derivatives exchanges – based on comments made by CFTC Chair Benham as he ramps up the enforcement division of the commission to set precedents by targeting non-compliant crypto exchanges. Will it take multiple business failures to convince the crypto industry to mature and take their regulatory reality more seriously in the U.S.? Possibly. What we’ve seen in the past few months from regulators are existential challenges to the crypto industry: The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and Federal Reserve Board are warning banks away; and Kraken and BlockFI have each received cease-and-desist orders for product lines in the past year. In the past month, we’ve also seen the TZero crypto app (an Overstock product) deciding to discontinue services due to regulatory challenges related to failures in their customer disclosures. There is one argument in crypto regulation that makes sense: the need for regulatory clarity – though, even this is diminishing with ever more enforcement actions. We may need to trade the bad phrase “regulation by enforcement” for “regulatory clarity by enforcement.” At least the latter is something less difficult to argue against. In other words, why not just continue to ask regulators to state clearly what the rules are instead of begging them to stop suing you? Regulatory clarity is a simple hurdle to clear. We’ve seen this with money-laundering regulation. In 2019 FinCEN issued FIN-2019-G001, FinCEN’s guidance on the “Application of FinCEN’s Regulations to Certain Business Models Involving Convertible Virtual Currencies.” Since 2019 there has been nothing in the U.S. with the same level of explicit detail stating how rules apply to crypto and under what circumstances. As a result, we see every crypto company, with few exceptions, registered as a money services business and adhering to the five pillars of Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) compliance . With the SEC and CFTC, where there is no such explicit guidance, we see continued non-registration and consequent enforcement actions, settlements and cease-and-desist orders. There’s a clear causal relationship here between guidance and compliance. Therefore, it is time for crypto executives and decision makers to think critically about regulations, stop complaining, hire better legal and compliance personnel who will tell them the hard truths (you are regulated, time to register), and have a more productive dialogue with regulators than they’ve had to date.

The office of Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis was ordered Monday by a judge to release three sections of the lengthy report — the introduction, conclusion and a section in which the grand jury ""discusses its concern that some witnesses may have lied under oath during their testimony."" The rest of the report was ordered to be kept under wraps until prosecutors complete their investigation. Media organizations including CBS News had argued that the full report should be made public immediately, but Fulton County Judge Robert McBurney largely rejected their effort. The grand jury, a 23-person panel of Georgians with three alternates, interviewed 75 witnesses while probing efforts by Trump and his allies to overturn the presidential election. They served as an investigatory body that could recommend charges but could not indict. They recommended in their report that it be released, according to McBurney. Willis' office has indicated in court filings that others have faced scrutiny in the probe, including a group of 16 Georgia Republicans who participated in an alternate elector scheme and former Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani .

141,"China sanctions Lockheed Martin, Raytheon over weapons sales to Taiwan",I,2023-02-16 10:37:25,"Beijing — China on Thursday imposed trade and investment sanctions on Lockheed Martin and a unit of Raytheon for supplying weapons to Taiwan, stepping up efforts to isolate the island democracy claimed by the ruling Communist Party as part of its territory . Lockheed Martin Corp. and Raytheon Technologies Corp.'s Raytheon Missiles and Defense are barred from importing goods into China or making new investments in the country, the Ministry of Commerce announced. It said they were added to the ""unreliable entity"" list of companies whose activities are restricted because they might endanger national sovereignty, security or development interests. It wasn't clear what impact the penalties might have. The United States bars most sales of weapons-related technology to China, but some military contractors also have civilian businesses in aerospace and other markets. Taiwan and China split in 1949 after a civil war. The island of 22 million people never has been part of the People's Republic of China, but the Communist Party says it is obliged to unite with the mainland, by force if necessary. President Xi Jinping's government has stepped up efforts to intimidate Taiwan by flying fighter jets and bombers near the island and firing missiles into the sea. The United States has no official relations with Taiwan but maintains extensive commercial and informal contacts. Washington is obligated by federal law to make sure the island's government has the means to defend itself. The United States is Taiwan's main supplier of military equipment. Raytheon Missiles and Defense, part of Raytheon Technologies Corp., was awarded a $412 million contract in September to upgrade Taiwanese military radar as part of a $1.1 billion package of U.S. arms sales to the island. Boeing Defense received a $355 million contract to supply Harpoon missiles. Beijing responded to that sale by announcing sanctions against the CEOs of Raytheon and of Boeing Defense but gave no details of what they were. Lockheed Martin has supplied Taiwan's military with radar, helicopters and air traffic control equipment. It plays a role in the island's development of its own fighter jet and navy frigates. In China, Lockheed Martin has sold air traffic control equipment for civilian airports and helicopters for commercial use. Beijing announced plans for the ""unreliable entity"" list in 2019 in response to U.S. restrictions imposed on Huawei Technologies Ltd., a Chinese maker of telecom equipment.

142,Stimulus Check Tax Review By IRS For Middle-Class California Refunds,Md Shahnawaz,2023-02-16 05:35:28,"Economy Stimulus Check Stimulus Check Tax Review By IRS For Middle-Class California Refunds By Md Shahnawaz - February 16, 2023 Stimulus Check The people of California have been waiting for a very long time to know their tax fate made by IRS regarding the stimulus check received from them. The IRS recently announced that several of the US states had offered stimulus payments to their residents and this payment might not be taxed by them. Under the special state refunds or payments given to millions of Americans all over the nation during 2022, Californians also received stimulus checks and are eager to know if they need to report it as a source of income. California Stimulus Check Payment Taxation The residents of California had previously received MCTRs (Tax Refunds for the Middle Class) that were meant to support people during the time of financial crises. The state government shelled out its surplus funds worth a whopping $9 billion to provide stimulus checks to 31 million beneficiaries. This was reported by the Tax Board Franchise of California. Some weeks back, the IRS informed the taxpayers to hold off on their tax filing for the year 2022 since they were determining the standard taxation status in relation to these special stimulus payments. Eventually, IRS stated that the California MCTRs will not be taxed. This is indeed great news for Californians. IRS Gives Good News The agency has determined that the people of California have time before their next tax filing. On the other hand, this announcement from IRS arrived later in the California Golden State since they have already started giving out the form 1099-MISC to their residents. This form is used by people whose monthly income is over $600 and who must use it for tax filing. Nonetheless, this good news from IRS is a huge tax relief for Californians. The people will have to file by the 18 th of April which is the Tax Day for 2023.

144,San Mateo County authorizes housing funding for Half Moon Bay mass shooting victims,I,2023-02-16 01:48:00,"SAN MATEO COUNTY - The San Mateo County Board of Supervisors this week allocated $750,000 to provide long-term temporary housing for those displaced by two mass shootings at farm sites in Half Moon Bay in January, and the county has also established a task force to investigate living conditions of its farmworkers. The focus of the task force is to try to improve living conditions by identifying farm operators who are not in compliance with state and local regulations that impact the health and safety of farmworkers and their families, according to the county. County regulations require farm operators to have permits if at least five people are living on-site. County Executive Mike Callagy said earlier this month that there are 18 such farms in the county, but the number of unpermitted locations has not been determined. The task force will be made up of members of the county's Departments of Planning and Building, Environmental Health, Agriculture/Weights and Measures, County Attorney's Office and the District Attorney's Office. At its meeting Tuesday, the Board of Supervisors unanimously approved funding from the American Rescue Plan meant to pay for housing for the next year for the 38 people displaced by the shootings, but left another $750,000 of the estimated $1.5 million cost unfunded, with the goal of seeking private donations to cover the rest. Some of the cost could be mitigated by contributions from the owners of the farms where the shootings took place, as the residences have been red-tagged for code violations. The county health code requires property owners in unincorporated areas to pay up to three months in temporary housing costs in such an event. Property owners within Half Moon Bay city limits are required to cover up to two months. ""We will voluntarily seek those, but I always say that we've got the best law office in the state and if necessary, we'll utilize them to recover those damages,"" Callagy said. Supervisor Noelia Corzo said the task force should not be used to force people living in substandard conditions to become unhoused, and cited what could become escalating costs if the county truly confronts how many people are potentially living in such conditions. She said there needs to be more examination of the root cause of the housing issues facing farmworkers in the county. Supervisor Ray Mueller, who represents District 3 where the displaced farmworkers were living, said the concerns were valid and the county was working with state and local partners to try to identify housing solutions, including what he called 'mercy centers' that could provide temporary housing if code violations are found to the point of causing displacement. A $42.8 million state grant awarded Wednesday will bolster the effort to find long-term housing solutions for low-income residents in the county, although just 18 of the 212 units will be dedicated to farmworkers, according to a news release from the county. The grant announced Wednesday will contribute funding to 212 units for low-income residents in Burlingame, Daly City and Moss Beach. ""This award is a major step forward to improve the lives of families and farmworkers on the Coastside,"" Mueller said in a statement. Callagy said at the board's meeting Tuesday that it is the county's goal to encourage farm operators to come forward and work with the county on improving living conditions for workers. ""It's those bad actors that live in the shadows that don't want to come forward that if we find we will bring them into compliance,"" Callagy said.",politics,144

Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park) introduced Assembly Bill 1054, which would ensure that all of the state's public high school students have access to computer science education. If approved, California would join 27 other states that already require high schools offer the courses. ""People move here from all across the globe with bold ideas and big dreams of changing the world,"" Berman said in a statement. ""But the reality is that far too many California students grow up in the shadows of these tech companies, yet go to schools that don't even offer them the opportunity to learn the skills they need to one day work there."" According to Berman's office, while more than 75% of high school students in the state attend a school that offers computer science, disparities continue to persist. Schools that are less likely to offer the courses are largely in rural areas, urban areas and in schools with high percentages of economically-disadvantaged students. ""This is indefensible,"" said Berman, whose district covers major Silicon Valley communities such as Mountain View and Palo Alto. The assemblymember said AB1054 would help train the state's future workforce and help California remain competitive with other states and nations.

150,If Nikki Haley is the first of many to run — Trump will win,Elaine Kamarck,2023-02-15 21:03:43,"FixGov If Nikki Haley is the first of many to run — Trump will win Elaine Kamarck Wednesday, February 15, 2023 FixGov Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Print SMS Email More Reddit Elaine Kamarck Founding Director - Center for Effective Public Management Senior Fellow - Governance Studies Twitter EKamarck Nikki Haley, former Governor of South Carolina and former Ambassador to the United Nations announced this week that she was running for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024. She is the second to announce, after former President Donald Trump, but she will not be the last. She is likely to be followed by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, by former Vice President Mike Pence and by former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Other, more obscure candidates may also follow given that, in recent years, running for president has become a career move towards a gig on Fox or CNN or a way to sell books or just a mammoth ego trip. Many things will happen between now and the Republican convention in 2024 and most of them are, at this point in time, unknowable. But there is one thing we do know — if there are many candidates running for the Republican nomination and they all stay in the race — Trump will win. Here’s why. The Republican party rules governing how delegates are awarded to presidential candidates are determined state by state. Taken together they have a bias in favor of candidates who win by a small number of votes. In 2016, Donald Trump was able to win the Republican nomination because he was the plurality winner of a crowded field (11 other candidates) in many states and congressional districts. Trump won 45% of the votes in the primaries and caucuses, but because of the rules for allocating delegates he won 70% of the votes on the first ballot at the convention. These results are likely to be repeated in 2024 if Trump faces a large field of candidates. In 2016, Republican state parties used five different types of rules for awarding delegates to presidential candidates. Nine states awarded delegates proportionally — these states accounted for 13% of the delegates to the Republican convention. Three other states elected their delegates on the same ballot as the presidential preference poll. These accounted for 7% of the delegates. The remaining states, accounting for the vast majority of delegates, used some sort of winner-take-all rule. [1] The most familiar of these is winner-take-all by state where the winner of the state, no matter how small the win, wins all the delegates. For instance, Trump won 45.7% of the vote in Florida in 2016 and won all the state’s 99 delegates. Other states award delegates based on the percentage of the vote a candidate gets in a congressional district. In Tennessee, in 2016, if a candidate won more than 66% of the vote in a district, they could win all the delegates. Trump won 39% of the popular vote there but 57% of the delegates. The effects of winner-take-all or winner-take-most rules can be seen in the following table from the 2016 race. Note that in each case Trump’s share of the delegates exceeded his share of the popular vote. If Cruz, Kasich and Rubio were one candidate instead of 3, the non-Trump candidate would have accumulated delegates and won the nomination. How the “Hybrid” System Helped Trump State Allocation system Trump vote Trump delegates Vote of Cruz, Kasich, and Rubio Delegates won by Cruz, Kasich, and Rubio Alabama Hybrid 43.4 36 44.2 14 Arkansas Hybrid 32.8 16 59.0 24 Georgia Hybrid 38.8 42 53.6 34 Oklahoma Hybrid 28.3 14 64.0 27 Note: Votes do not include all candidates which is why they don’t add up to 100%. Primary Politics: Everything You Need to Know About How America Nominates Its Presidential Candidates, Elaine C. Kamarck, (Brookings Press 2019, Third edition) Page 155 In 2020, Trump was an incumbent president and like many before him he faced no serious opposition for the Republican nomination. To be sure however, he did what many previous sitting presidents have done and used his influence to shape a set of rules to his liking. For Trump in 2020 this meant increasing the number of winner-take-all by state primaries from seven to 17 (accounting for 39% of the delegates) and increasing the number of “hybrid” systems (where a candidate crossing a certain threshold, usually 50%, can win all the delegates) from 14 to 17 (accounting for 34% of the delegates.) This was a smart move on Trump’s part, for while his nomination was never really in doubt, by limiting the number of delegates other candidates could win he guaranteed himself a convention free of challenges on issues like platform and rules.

Galston Friday, January 20, 2023 The 2024 Republican party’s rules are not yet final. One advantage of having run for a nomination in the past, however, is that Trump’s operatives are probably working hard to make sure this nomination system is a favorable one for Trump. Other than that Trump has to hope that many others get into the race and that, as in 2016, most of them stay in the race until the bitter end — hoping lightening will strike. Finally, Trump has to hope that Republican primary voters in 2024 don’t re-run the Democratic race in 2020. That year, Joe Biden managed to win one of the early states, South Carolina. Several of his opponents got out and endorsed him and he sailed to victory, winning 10 of the big primaries on Super Tuesday. Republicans are very aware of why Trump won in 2016 — in spite of their doubts about him. In 2024, one can imagine substantial pressure on Haley, Pence, Pompeo or others who get into the race to get out in time to coalesce around a non-Trump candidate. In addition, Trump has to have a substantial base that sticks with him through the primaries and there are some signs that Republican voters are looking for a “Trump-lite” candidate for 2024 — someone who speaks to their anger but does not have quite the accumulation of baggage. Thus, the most likely way Trump loses his run for the Republican nomination in 2024 is if one of the lesser-known candidates becomes the Republican Biden, empties the field and wraps up the delegates. But if he keeps a solid base and multiple opponents stay in the race for the duration — Trump will win again.

151,Getting Back The Missing Stimulus Check: States Continue To Send Out Inflation Relief Payments In 2023,Md Shahnawaz,2023-02-15 19:58:13,"Economy Stimulus Check Top Stories Getting Back The Missing Stimulus Check: States Continue To Send Out Inflation Relief Payments In 2023 By Md Shahnawaz - February 15, 2023 Millions of Americans missed out on their federal stimulus checks and other relief measures initiated by the government as a response to the economic hardship caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. But it may not be too late to claim any of the missed stimulus checks. The main reason individuals and households missed out on the stimulus check is due to their absence in the records of the IRS or due to non-filing of their federal income tax returns for the past 2–3 years. But for many, merely filing their 2020 income tax returns should get them their first and second stimulus check, and filing their 2021 income tax returns will get them their third stimulus check. Individuals who missed out on any of the federal stimulus checks will have to wait for the 2023 income tax season to begin. They will get help with filing their 2020 or 2021 income tax return. They may also claim their missing stimulus check through GetYourRefund.org, which opened on January 31, 2023 . Claiming The Recovery Rebate Credit On The Tax Return Individuals and families may get the Recovery Rebate Credit by filing their previous income tax returns. The returns that they need to file depend on the stimulus check they have missed. For the initial two stimulus checks given out under the CARES Act for the first stimulus check and the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2021 for the second payment, they have the free filing option through the GetYourRefund.org site. For the third stimulus check that is part of the American Rescue Plan Act of March 2021, individuals and joint filers have the chance to avail of free filing through GetCTC.org for a combination of missing stimulus checks, claimants have to file through the GetYourRefund.org site. For the first and the second stimulus check, claimants had to file a tax return for the 2020 tax year, which was in 2021. The deadline to file the returns was May 17, 2021, while the tax filing extension deadline was on October 15, 2021. For those who missed out on the filing deadline, there is still the option to file their income tax return to collect their first and second stimulus checks. For those who do not owe taxes, there is no penalty for filing late. Those owing taxes may be subject to penalties and fines for not filing or not paying their taxes. The tax authorities may also reduce their tax refund to pay for any taxes that they owe as federal and state government debts. Further details about the options open for those who may owe taxes may be obtained by visiting the IRS site and going through the ‘Filing Past Due Tax Returns’ or the ‘What to do if I Owe Taxes but Can’t Pay Them’ part. For the third stimulus check, filers need to file their income tax return for the 2021 tax year which they were scheduled to file in 2022. The deadline for filing the returns was April 18, 2022, while the tax filing extension deadline was on October 17, 2022. The IRS also sent out letters to around 10 million residents who missed out on their stimulus check payments mainly due to their records being absent in the data of the IRS and the treasury department. States Continue To Send Out Payments From 2022 Around 21 states have sent out relief payments in 2022 to residents to combat inflation that reached record figures, the highest in more than 40 years. For those who missed out on the payments, there are ways they can recover the amount . Over 50M Americans received some form of stimulus check or tax refund as state government stepped in to help out residents to tide over rising prices. This unprecedented inflation adversely affected the prices of every product and good from gasoline to groceries. But as with the federal stimulus checks or the economic impact payments, many residents missed out on the state inflation relief payments. But there are ways that individuals and joint filers can still claim any missing stimulus checks. While some might not qualify under the conditions stipulated by the state administration, others might have missed out on the payments because the state tax agency might not have their present address or their banking details. There is also the possibility that their income tax returns for 2021 , to be filed in 2022, were not filed correctly. You would first need to find out if your state issued a stimulus check and whether you ticked all the qualification boxes to get the stimulus check. You would then need to inquire about any missing inflation rebate payments. While the state stimulus checks were mostly paid out by the states in the first and the second quarter of 2022, some states planned their inflation relief payments for the last quarter, coinciding with the festive season. Alaska was among the first states to declare payments to residents. But the Dept. of Revenue of the state only began issuing the payments on September 20 last year. Most Alaskans received a Permanent Fund Dividend that allowed them a part of the oil and other mineral revenues. Last year, soaring international oil prices allowed the state to send their residents a generous $650 as an energy relief payment. The PFD stimulus check amount for 2022 has seen a huge leap and has touched $3,284 in 2022, which is a 195% increase from the previous year. California had earlier issued two rounds of payments under the Golden State Stimulus Checks I and II. Governor Gavin Newsom decided to send out gas and transit cards worth $400 to individuals and families if they had a vehicle registered in the Golden State. The plan was changed to a third round of stimulus checks for 23M residents of California. Single filers with an Adjusted Gross Income below $250,000 and joint filers with an AGI below $500,000 received a Middle-Class Tax Refund ( MCTR ) worth between $200 and $1,050 depending on their AGI. Joint filers with a state AGI of $150,000 or less for 2021 received the maximum amount of $1,050 if they declared a dependent in their state returns for 2021. The highest individual tax refund amount is $350. Those who did not receive their payment should call up the Franchise Tax Board at 800-542-9332.

156,Proposed California bill would ban 'junk' fees for goods and services,I,2023-02-15 15:38:16,"SACRAMENTO -- Bay Area Sens. Nancy Skinner and Bill Dodd and state Attorney General Rob Bonta announced a bill Tuesday that would ban hidden fees for goods and services like concert tickets and hotels. Senate Bill 478 would prevent platforms from tacking mandatory hidden surcharges like service and order processing fees onto purchases. The bill would require sales platforms to include all required charges other than government-imposed taxes and fees as part of a good or service's face value price. ""These junk fees cost consumers billions of dollars each year and hurt vulnerable families at a time when every dollar matters that much more,"" Bonta said. ""This deceptive practice also hurts businesses that are doing business the right way by being transparent about prices."" A 2019 Consumer Reports poll found that some 85 percent of U.S. residents had faced an unexpected or hidden fee over the prior two years. On Tuesday, Bonta and the two legislators argued that companies are attaching hidden fees to goods and services more and more frequently. ""California families are hurting, whether it's inflation, high gas prices and then this, whether it's a hotel, the ticket broker for a special event or the airlines who slam us with baggage fees or a fee to sit with our family,"" said Skinner, D-Berkeley. ""All of these are exorbitant and just too costly."" Lawmakers will discuss the bill as soon as mid-March once it has been in print for at least a month. https://www.baycitynews.com/images/BCN-20211222-NEWSOM-06.JPG Caption: California state Sen. for District 9 Nancy Skinner speaks about the rising omicron variant cases in California at Native American Health Center in Oakland, Calif., on Dec. 22, 2021.

157,"Ron DeSantis’s war on “woke” in Florida schools, explained",Fabiola Cineas,2023-02-15 13:30:00,"In 2020, Ron DeSantis’s administration declared him the “ Education Governor ” for how eager he was to dramatically change the state’s education system. Three years later, he’s provoked — and been engulfed in — an ongoing list of education controversies as part of his fight against “ woke ideology,” or schools acknowledging or teaching about systemic injustice in American society. As DeSantis prepares to announce his campaign for the presidency, as many have speculated, he has ramped up his involvement in Florida schools. Not only is he doubling down on existing legislation, he’s also introducing new rules and regulations — and making sure the Education Department follows through. While he largely focused on K-12 in the early years of his term, this year he has launched new plans to remake higher education. Before this year, he had already signed a bill to ban transgender athletes from women’s and girls’ public school teams and banned more than 40 percent of math textbooks that publishers submitted for review, which he said contained “woke” ideology. He passed the Florida Parental Rights in Education Act, which he called an effort to give more parents control over what their children learn at school but critics called the “Don’t Say Gay” bill . He endorsed more than a dozen candidates for school board in 2022 and spent more than $2 million in the races, with 24 out of the 30 candidates he supported winning their races, while he won reelection by 19 points. He also passed a contentious bill that allowed more teachers to be armed at school. This year, DeSantis isn’t slowing down. He has picked a fight with the College Board over AP African American studies and has hinted at doing away with AP courses altogether. His laws against the teaching of race, sexual orientation, and gender have led to strict book bans in various school districts. In higher education, the governor is rolling back diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives; reducing tenure protections; and moving school leaders to review core courses to make sure they’re free of “liberal indoctrination.” All of this has ramifications beyond DeSantis himself — and could end up playing a role in Republicans’ national strategy. The Republican Party sees DeSantis’s approach to education as a winning approach that could provide a blueprint for the 2024 election, Axios reported earlier this month . Former President Donald Trump has unveiled proposals of his own, calling for parents to vote on school principals. DeSantis isn’t just choosing to make education central to his persona, hoping to benefit from parents upset about the direction of schools ; he’s inspiring other potential presidential contenders to follow suit. It can be hard to keep track of it all. So here’s a look at why Florida education is in the headlines. K-12 public schools The ongoing book banning campaign Book banning isn’t new , but Florida’s book regulations take the practice to a new level. A Florida law signed by DeSantis last March requires that all books available to children be “reviewed by a district employee holding a valid educational media specialist certificate,” such as the school librarian, since the state says teachers cannot be trusted to select appropriate texts for their students. This means that classroom libraries assembled by teachers violate the law, and parts of the state — up to one-third of the state’s counties, according to reporting from the New Yorker — have restricted access to all books until they could be reviewed. Photo of a classroom library at Bayshore High School in Manatee County, Florida after they banned all classroom libraries. Florida considers books to be more dangerous to students than assault rifles. This is truly a dystopian state. pic.twitter.com/CizSGR40ub — Alejandra Caraballo (@Esqueer_) January 23, 2023 As a result of recent rules about the type of books that are unacceptable, announced by the Florida Department of Education in compliance with the law, teachers were required to bar students from accessing school libraries until the books are reviewed. According to an investigation by Popular Information, books in some school districts including Manatee County must be checked against the school district’s library catalog: If it’s in the catalog, it is approved, but those that aren’t in the catalog must be reviewed. Students are also not allowed to bring books from home or read books on apps. Teachers or librarians who fail to follow the new guidelines may be subject to criminal prosecution. Florida’s Education Commissioner Manny Diaz Jr. defended the law in a tweet last month: “A teacher (or any adult) faces a felony if they knowingly distribute egregious material, such as images which depict sexual conduct, sexual battery, bestiality, or sadomasochistic abuse. Who could be against that?” Rejecting AP African American studies with the Stop WOKE Act DeSantis announced last month that the state is blocking AP African American studies , a new class developed by the College Board, on the grounds that it is “a political agenda” and an example of “woke indoctrination.” The administration objected to certain topics contained in a draft framework for the course: queer theory, intersectionality, Black Lives Matter, reparations, prison abolition, and more. At a press conference in January, DeSantis said the course is on “the wrong side of the line for Florida standards.” He added, “We believe in teaching kids facts and how to think, but we don’t believe they should have an agenda imposed on them. When you try to use Black history to shoehorn in queer theory, you are clearly trying to use that for political purposes.” Florida rejected the course under its Stop WOKE Act (Stop the Wrongs to Our Kids and Employees Act), which took effect in July 2022 and bans schools and businesses from teaching anything that could make anyone feel “guilt, anguish or any form of psychological distress” because of their race, gender, sex, or national origin. Though a judge ordered a temporary injunction against parts of the law that limit conversations about race in public colleges and universities, the law remains mostly intact. Florida’s rejection of the course has created nonstop controversy for the College Board and opened up a broader discussion about how race is taught in America and who gets to control knowledge in public schools. Since DeSantis denounced the course last month, it has been revealed that the College Board likely sanitized the curriculum after communicating with Florida’s Department of Education, though College Board denies this. The fight between DeSantis and the College Board isn’t over, either: This week, DeSantis hinted at ending the state’s relationship with the College Board altogether. Higher education Eliminating DEI programs and initiatives At the start of the year, DeSantis called for the elimination of diversity, equity, and inclusion programs. The programs became required in 2020, ordered by a largely Republican-appointed board, while he was already in his second year as governor. A January 31 order from DeSantis prohibits higher education institutions from using any funding, no matter the source, to support DEI or critical race theory — the besieged academic framework that says racism is systemic — and anything else the administration considers “discriminatory initiatives.” Last month, higher education officials who work on DEI committees reported having their emails searched. Others reported that their institution’s administrators canceled all scheduled DEI programs. I was notified recently my email will be searched because of my service on a DEI committee. This is higher education in Florida https://t.co/6uyaDfpSx2 — Hannah Bayne (@hannahbbayne) January 25, 2023 Faculty, staff, and student email accounts at UF are being searched with almost NO explanation or show of support from above; many finding out after the fact. People are understandably scared, especially untenured or soft-money folks. https://t.co/jaghmA2RuP — Emilio M. Bruna (@BrunaLab) January 26, 2023 Some institutions rushed to go along with it. The presidents at 28 Florida state colleges pledged to end all “discriminatory DEI and CRT initiatives” at their institutions beginning February 1. In a letter , the presidents wrote that historically, DEI initiatives “served to increase diversity of thought as well as the enrollment and the success of underrepresented populations and promote the open access mission of our state college system.” But they argued that some of these initiatives and classroom lessons “have come to mean and accomplish the very opposite and seek to push ideologies such as critical race theory and its related tenets.” The letter went on to say that they also wouldn’t support any program, initiative, or academic requirement that “compels belief” in concepts like “intersectionality.” The letter also states that if critical race theory is part of a postsecondary curriculum, it has to be presented among other viewpoints. Cracking down on coursework DeSantis wants school leaders to review course material. On January 31, he announced that the State University System Board of Governors and the State Board of Education must review general education core courses to make sure that they are historically accurate, “foundational,” and “career relevant.” The administration has not publicly explained what “foundational” or “career relevant” means. The boards must also ensure that core classes don’t “suppress or distort” historical events or include “identity politics” in their curriculum. The governor also wants to require schools to give priority to “graduating students with degrees that lead to high-wage jobs, not degrees designed to further a political agenda,” but hasn’t specified which degrees they are referring to. His proposed overhaul would also mandate courses in Western civilization. Dismantling tenure and tamping down on hiring DeSantis urged schools to bypass their tenure systems to conduct post-tenure reviews of faculty members “at any time with cause.” “They can be let go if they’re not performing to expectations,” he observed, adding that “the most significant dead-weight cost to a university is unproductive tenured faculty.” He also empowered school presidents and boards to “take ownership” of their hiring and retention decisions without interference from unions or faculty committees. Targeting trans health care Last month, the governor instructed state universities to report on whether they used public funding for gender-affirming health care, a move that’s in line with the administration’s broader effort to end health care for transgender people . In a memo , Chris Spencer, the director of Florida’s Office of Policy and Budget, wrote, “Our office has learned that several state universities provide services to persons suffering from gender dysphoria. On behalf of the Governor, I hereby request that you respond to the enclosed inquiries related to such services.” The memo directed the universities to report the number of people who received that gender-affirming treatment in the last five years and where it was provided. Schools were instructed to also report how many students were prescribed puberty blockers, hormones, or hormone antagonists, or underwent a surgical procedure. The administration also requested information about the number of students diagnosed with gender identity disorders. It’s unclear what the administration plans to do with the information. The LGBTQ activist group Equality Florida told Politico that the decision was “incredibly disturbing” since it is “another example of DeSantis using his office to attempt to intimidate colleges and universities into becoming less inclusive of their students for his political gain.” The administration’s memo comes at a time when the Florida High School Athletic Association, the group that controls school athletic programs across the state, was weighing whether to make optional questions about students’ menstrual cycles mandatory on athletic participation forms. Reining in the progressive New College of Florida DeSantis is staging what’s being called a “ hostile takeover ” of the New College of Florida, a small school in Sarasota. As part of his 2023-2024 budget recommendations, DeSantis wants to spend $100 million to recruit and retain faculty members at Florida’s state universities, and in addition, he wants to allocate another $15 million to “overhaul and restructure” the New College of Florida. The budget request and the appointment of new board members has students and faculty at the college staging protests against him to “Save New College and Defend Educational Freedom.” According to students, as DeSantis looks for targets in his ever-expanding education culture, he’s using them as guinea pigs to show the rest of the country what he might be capable of as president. The New College of Florida is really small, with enrollment at just 650 to 700 students. Progressive-minded undergraduates have long flocked to New College, founded in 1960, for its tolerance of queer students and a kind of academic freedom that’s at odds with DeSantis’s platform. On January 6, DeSantis announced that he was appointing six new members to the college’s 13-member board of trustees. Each new member is a right-wing ally of DeSantis’s, including Christopher Rufo, the political strategist who takes credit for launching the war on critical race theory in 2021. One of the new board’s first moves was to fire the college’s president , Patricia Okker, without cause, and replace her with Richard Corcoran, a former Florida education commissioner and Republican legislator, who has been called out for having not any academic qualifications to lead an academic institution. The board has also suggested that the school adopt a curriculum based on the conservative, Christian Hillsdale College based in Michigan whose graduate school dean joined New College’s board . The board told students that its next moves will likely be to dismantle all DEI programs and initiatives. Will you support Vox’s explanatory journalism?

158,"Joe Biden is mad about hidden fees and you should be, too",Emily Stewart,2023-02-15 12:30:00,"President Joe Biden speaks during his State of the Union address at the Capitol in Washington, DC, on February 7, 2023. | Nathan Howard/Bloomberg via Getty Images You are not the only person who thinks resort fees are ridiculous and it shouldn’t cost you $200 to cancel your cable. To exist in the economy in this day and age is to constantly be bombarded by fees. It’s often not clear what they’re for, or why they’re necessary, or when they’re even going to appear. One minute you’re trying to buy concert tickets on Ticketmaster for X dollars, and boom, the cost leaps by 30 percent to Y dollars, thanks to random fees you can’t even see unless you click a little drop-down arrow to figure out the provenance of the extra charge. Or you’re booking a flight, and somehow the original cost of your seat has skyrocketed when all is said and done. Or you just want to sit next to your elementary schooler on the plane, and there’s a charge for that, too. President Joe Biden knows America’s fees-riddled economy can feel frustrating, deceptive, and, of course, expensive. And so, to channel some Elizabeth Warren here, he’s got a plan for that: He’s calling for a Junk Fee Prevention Act in an effort to ax hidden fees and take aim at the ways consumers are nickeled and dimed by corporations. This is part of the White House’s broader efforts to try to increase competition across the economy and go after the proliferation of fees in industries ranging from banking to ticketing to travel. In October, the White House also rolled out a blog post outlining its plans to take on junk fees, and the FTC announced it would explore a rule to take a look at the issue. Other agencies, including the CFPB and the Department of Transportation, are taking a crack at fees in their respective areas as well. “Junk fees may not matter to the very wealthy, but they matter to most folks in homes like the one I grew up in. They add up to hundreds of dollars a month. They make it harder for you to pay the bills or afford that family trip,” Biden said at his State of the Union address in February. “I know how unfair it feels when a company overcharges you and gets away with it. Not anymore.” Right now, the Junk Fee Prevention Act is basically a plan to have a plan — there’s no actual bill yet. The White House is trying to tackle the fees issue from multiple angles. The idea here isn’t necessarily that companies can’t charge for their services, but instead that they’ve got to be fair and honest about those charges and compete for consumers’ business in a way that isn’t, to put it plainly, tricky. If the only way to get a Beyoncé ticket or book your Cancún vacation is to pay the extra charges, they’re not really extras anymore, they’re just kind of the price “That’s bad for market efficiency, that’s bad for firms that price in an honest way, and if you’re an industry and you’re choosing how to innovate, if junk fees are permissible, then one way to make more profits is to come up with new and more sophisticated junk fees rather than actually making your product better or making your product lower cost,” one White House official told me, speaking on condition of anonymity. If the only way to get a Beyoncé ticket or book your Cancún vacation is to pay the extra charges, they’re not really extras anymore, they’re just kind of the price. “Basic economics teaches us that there’s supply and demand and prices are market signals. Common sense shows that people shop and compare goods on the basis of price, among other things,” said Aaron Klein, senior fellow in economics at the think tank Brookings Institution, in an interview. “The internet revolutionized how we bought and sold goods and services, so what we’re finding is that in the quest to have the lowest price, cost is being moved from price to fees, so that consumers think they’re buying something at a cheaper price when in point of fact the true cost to that might be higher.” What’s in the still-to-come Junk Fee Prevention Act The Junk Fee Prevention Act doesn’t exist as actual full legislative text on Capitol Hill. For now, it’s more talking points as the White House gets the ball rolling, and it’s still not clear with whom. One senior Democratic congressional aide who Vox granted anonymity in order to speak freely on the matter said they have “no fucking clue” on the bill and that as far as they know it is “made up.” A White House spokesperson who agreed to speak anonymously said they are having “productive conversations” with many members of Congress who have expressed interest in junk fees and noted there has been bipartisan interest in the issue in the past, including from Republican Reps. Ann Wagner of Missouri and Paul Gosar of Arizona. As mentioned, the Biden administration is also taking aim at fees at the agency level to try to tackle some of these problems from different avenues. In broad outlines, the junk fee legislation the White House is advocating for Congress to take up would take aim at four areas: Concerts, sporting events, and entertainment ticket fees. Anyone who’s tried to buy tickets for a Taylor Swift concert or any other event recently is well aware, the process can be a mess, including and often especially when it comes to extra charges. Consumers are met with nebulous service fees and venue fees when making a purchase, and those fees often appear at the end of the buying process and make up a significant chunk of the final price. The White House wants Congress to bar excessive fees, require those fees be disclosed in the ticket price from the start, and make sellers disclose holdbacks of tickets that diminish supply (and can therefore drive up prices). Elsewhere in the government, the Department of Justice has reportedly undertaken an antitrust investigation against Live Nation Entertainment, the company born after Ticketmaster and Live Nation merged in 2010 that is the one charging a lot of these fees. Extra charges for sitting next to your kid on a plane. If you have flown lately, you’ve probably noticed airlines often now charge you extra for choosing a seat. It’s annoying for any traveler who remembers the days when sitting somewhere not terrible on a flight did not run you $50. For parents, the stakes can be higher — they are often faced with the choice of paying to sit next to their child or hoping a kind stranger will switch seats. (The kindness of strangers is not guaranteed.) In July 2022, the Department of Transportation put out a notice urging airlines to “do everything in their power to ensure that children who are age 13 or younger are seated next to an accompanying adult with no additional charge,” but no airlines actually guarantee this one yet. The DOT is still working on the matter with a fees dashboard and a potential rule to ban sit-by-your-child charges. Still, it’s hoping Congress can fast-track the matter by including a ban on these fees in legislation. Fees for quitting your cable company, your phone plan, or your internet service. When you sign up to get cable or internet in your home or open up a new phone plan, it often comes with a set time frame — and a financial punishment if you want to back out before that time frame ends. Quitting early can cost tens and hundreds of dollars. The White House makes the case that these early termination fees hurt market dynamism “by making it harder for innovative companies to win a toe-hold in the market by encouraging customers to switch.” Essentially, if a company wants to keep your business, it should have to do so by having a competitive offer, not by threatening to charge you a bunch of money if you go elsewhere. Biden wants Congress to ax “excessive” early termination fees so companies can’t lock in customers with the threat of a giant bill if they switch phone companies. Surprise charges that make what’s supposed to be your fun vacation a little less fun. The story with resort fees and destination fees is similar to what happens with concert tickets: The consumer sees one price for a hotel room when they start their vacation planning, and by the time they hit checkout, that total amount has jumped. The charade makes it hard to comparison shop because the low price shown at the outset can get pretty meaningless. As the advocacy group Kill Resort Fees notes, there’s not much stopping a hotel from advertising a $1 room rate and $99 in fees. It’s often not clear what these fees are for, beyond making hotels and resorts more money. The hotel industry makes billions of dollars in fees and surcharges each year. “The hotel likes to say that they provide amenities in exchange for that resort fee, but it’s a complete and total lie,” said Lauren Wolfe, the founder of the website Kill Resort Fees. “The resort fee exists so that the hotel can lie to consumers about the advertised price.” The White House wants Congress to bar surprise fees by making hotels include them in room prices up front. The idea here is there ought to be some limits on how companies charge you for random stuff Much of what the White House is pushing for isn’t that companies shouldn’t be allowed to impose various fees and charges for different services ever (though in some instances that is the case). What it’s saying is that there should be a cap on the amount those companies can collect so that arrangement is a little less predatory or, at the very least, companies should have to tell you how much something costs with the fees included from the get-go. It’s also looking to discourage the proliferation of fees across various industries and companies. In multiple sectors, there’s a culture of exploitative fees, and the hope is to reverse the tide and make companies think twice about adding on extra charges. There are areas where specific fees and charges make sense, and where differential pricing seems fair. At the very least, you can sometimes see the argument for them. In flying, for example, airlines say that much of what they’ve done is to disaggregate different options and services so travelers can sort of pick and choose what they want. The idea is that you see the stripped-down price initially and then decide whether you want to pay to check a bag, sit comfortably, print your ticket, whatever. (Vox has a whole explainer on the airline fee situation here.) Reasonable minds can disagree about whether this business practice is good. Some people really do want the lowest fare and are happy to take that middle seat in the back. At the same time, the checked bag fee distorts behavior because then everybody tries to bring their bags on the plane. And fees often add up so quickly that the original price you’re shown when booking on a website like Expedia or Google Flights, ultimately, ends up being a complete lie. “Free market competition assumes transparent information about prices” “The airlines that competed on price in the same search engine started moving cost to things like bag fees and other things so you would think, ‘Oh, this is the cheapest flight,’ and buy it, and you get to the airport and boom. Same thing with the hotels,” Klein said. “Free market competition assumes transparent information about prices, and what we’ve seen are companies, and broadly speaking industries, moving toward taking something out of one price tag and moving it to another.” Again, this Junk Fee Prevention Act is not an actual thing that exists at the moment. If and when it does (which, you know, we have a Congress that often doesn’t do much), it’s not entirely clear how implementation would work. Which resort fees are unfair and which are for a legitimate thing? Is there a way to opt out of whatever amenities they correspond to? What would travel website designs need to look like? What counts as a fair rate for quitting your phone plan early, and how much exactly does that cost the company dealing with it? “There’s been too little policing of fees in the market, but I think implementation is challenging because sometimes the fees are correlated to different services,” Klein said. As the saying goes, the devil is in the details, but a lot of this stuff probably isn’t that hard to figure out — or at least it’s not as hard as many companies will likely say it is. It’s impossible not to note how much the economy has become overridden by fees. Banks charge a web of fees for accessing your own money or for making a mistake there’s no way it costs them that much to address. They often make money off of fees levied on those who can least afford it. The costs added onto food delivery services for consumers and restaurants are disorienting, and it’s never clear whether the fees companies say go to workers actually do. It’s impossible to know what so many goods and services are going to cost you because of charges and fees that consistently pop up. This isn’t good for anyone, ultimately, even businesses. Another White House official who spoke to me on condition of anonymity said he’s heard in conversations with some companies that they’d be amenable to tighter rules around fees — assuming everyone else has to go along. If you’re a ticketing platform and you’re the only one showing full prices up front while all your competitors are going to add them on later, you’re at a disadvantage. Consumers won’t choose you if there’s no way for them to know you’re actually the right choice. “That’s bad for consumers and it’s bad for industry in the long run,” Klein said. “We should be competing on the best service and the best price, not on who can shock you with the most fees at the end.”",politics,158
159,Facts About Slavery Some Black History Month Proponents Don’t Admit!,Don Boys,2023-02-15 11:58:38,"Facts About Slavery Some Black History Month Proponents Don’t Admit! by Don Boys February 15, 2023, 06:58 45 Views 5 Votes Black History Month is an effort by variously motivated black leaders to promote pride and self-respect in current Blacks. Often, truth and fiction are comingled into a confusing jumble of misinformation. As a white American interested in truth, I will add some balance to the narrative. There were comparatively few slaves in New England (usually one or two slaves per family, if any), but New York had many slaves. Slavery was not very beneficial in New York because the slaves had to be fed and cared for all year, yet the growing season was short. New Yorkers were very afraid of black slaves and had a constant fear of a slave uprising when Whites would be slaughtered in their sleep. There were few massive uprisings, but many small plots, fights, and flights during which a master or overseer was slain. So, in the early l700s, slaves were beaten if three or more congregated in one place unless they were working. That would keep down conspiracies, but if a slave killed a white person, he was tortured and executed. There was a slave uprising in New York City (population of about 8,000 citizens and 1,000 slaves) in 1712 in which nine Whites were killed, and the authorities hanged 13 slaves, and burned four alive (one over a slow fire). One slave was broken on the wheel, and one was left to starve to death in chains . So much for the sanctified, self-justification of the northern hypocrite. Now, to answer the sanctified, self-justification of the southern hypocrite. The southern planter sat on his porch, chewing tobacco, and drinking a cool glass of rum, and said, “Well, the southern slave is much better off than he was living in miserable squalor, sin, and superstition in darkest Africa.” No doubt, his living conditions were better, and his eating was more on schedule in slavery, but I remind you that Africa was home, and he had been forced from his home. In Africa, he was with his family, in lifetime surroundings, among friends, speaking his own language, and around his own culture. In American slavery, he was not his own man. Often, he was separated from his wife and children. He was the property of others. Even if he lived in a condominium on Virginia Beach, it was still wrong for him to be enslaved. It is also true that slavery was wrong even when the slave owner was kind, thoughtful, and benevolent. All slave owners were not haters and sadistic tyrants. Most of them were average businessmen who needed workers. It was not a good business practice to mistreat a worker. Dead slaves don’t work! Some slave owners were thoughtful and kind, which did not justify slavery. Some slave owners saw the wisdom in taking care of their slaves, even encouraging marriage to the extent of giving them a house, a plot of ground, and household goods. A slave with a family, home, garden, and some farm animals would be less inclined to rebellion. Slaves were not worked from daybreak to sundown. The January 1979 issue of Natural History reported, “Slaves spent their hours away from the field doing household chores, making handicrafts, hunting, and fishing, cultivating their own food, and entertaining themselves with dancing.” Archeological research at slave cabins in Georgia and Florida reveals that some slaves even had firearms! Black leftists would have us believe that all slaves were worked to death and were practically starved to death. However, that only happened when the owner was a sadist or an idiot! Two liberal (very liberal) professors tell us in their book, Time On The Cross: The Economics Of American Negro Slavery, that some planters instituted a profit-sharing for their slaves. They also reveal “the average pecuniary income actually received by a prime field hand was roughly fifteen percent greater than the income he would have received for his labor as a free agricultural worker.” Wonder why public school books and race-baiters on television never mention that. On some plantations, the best workers were given tobacco, whiskey, cash, holidays, and trips to town on the weekend. Rather substantial year-end bonuses were sometimes awarded. We are told that the slaves were docile and contented, but that is not true, especially in earlier years. There was a natural tendency for second-generation slaves to be less belligerent and more contented, but that was not true of the first-generation slaves. The facts debunk the “contented” theory. When the slaves arrived at the ports, the slaves were examined and branded with the mark of the new owner and then marched to the beach. Those Blacks brought from the interior were terrified of the pounding surf, the swaying slave ship, and the white traders. Some of the Blacks thought the white men were cannibals and would devour them on the beach. It was not uncommon for the captives to claw at the sand and attempt suicide rather than be crammed into the waiting ships. That doesn’t sound as if they meekly accepted slavery. Suicide was prevalent, especially upon leaving the African Coast since they had no idea what was happening to them. The Power to Die reveals that some slaves refused to eat or leaped into the sea, prompting some captains to install a net to make it more difficult to accomplish their desires. Many slaves strangled themselves, tore open their throats, and hanged themselves. In America, they jumped into rivers or out of windows or even ran into burning buildings. One sea captain wrote: “The negroes [sic] are so wilful [sic] and loth [sic] to leave their country, that they have often leaped out of the canoes, boat and ship, into the sea, and kept under water till they were drowned, to avoid being taken up and saved by our boats….” There are numerous incidents of slaves jumping into the sea, cutting their throats, self-strangling, and self-starvation. Upon arrival in their new land, those incidents drastically decreased; however, they did not give up the thought of freedom. There were many slave rebellions, although not massive, that resulted in many executions of the leaders. Any slave who reported a rebellion was rewarded with his freedom, so most “uprisings” did not result in freedom for many slaves. It is natural that the more vicious the owner, the greater would be the desire for freedom of his slaves; however, not all slave owners were cruel and sadistic men. Nat Turner was a slave in Southampton County, Virginia, and always felt he was destined to do great works that he thought were established by seeing spirits fighting in the night sky. He often heard voices which he often passed to his fellow slaves. After a solar eclipse, he was convinced it was an indication for him to lead his fellow slaves in a rebellion against their masters. One evening in 1831 he led a group of 75 slaves to attack and kill their masters as they slept. No child was spared or gender as they killed with guns, swords, clubs, and farm equipment. Some adults and children were beheaded. About 51 Whites plus ten or so others were killed in two days until the slaves were found and tried. Turner and 16 of his group were then executed in Jerusalem, Virginia. Some famous Americans who profess sanity even call Turner “legendary” (Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates) and spoke of his “heroism and sacrifices.” Say what? Movie producer Nate Parker described Turner as “a measured, self-determined man of faith, whose courage and sacrifice left him a martyr.” Nat wasn’t martyred; he was executed for the murder of innocent men, women, and children, even babies. Molefi Kete Asante, a scholar at Temple University calls Turner a “reflective and mature thinker” who “believed in liberty,” “demonstrated both gravitas and charisma” and “has earned his place in the panoply of revolutionary icons.” All three of the above promoters of Nat Turner have two things in common: they are all black and have major problems in their differentiation between right and wrong. They are missing a moral compass. Whatever the location and how kind the slave owners were, chattel slavery is always wrong. Many slave owners cared for their slaves and were interested in improving their living and working conditions. Of course, those owners were still wrong. Those owners would not have wanted to be slaves, so it was wrong for them to enslave others. Jesus taught that truth when He said in Matthew 7:12, “Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them….” That verse, if obeyed, would have wiped out slavery and all other injustices to men. Slavery cannot be justified; however, it is easy for us to criticize the early Americans from our present advantage of enlightenment and abundance. What would you have done if you had lived in Jamestown in the 1600s with a farm to be worked, no white laborers to hire, and starvation facing you and your family? It is never right to do wrong, but it is easy for us to sit in judgment from a comfortable distance of more than 350 years. While we can never condone slavery, let us at least be aware of the conditions that prompted it and be determined to never again enslave humans of any color for any reason.

161,Chart of the Day: Inflation Report Shows Inflation Still Lurking Just Below the Surface – Is it About to Reaccelerate?,Tom Williams,2023-02-15 11:49:14,"Chart of the Day: Inflation Report Shows Inflation Still Lurking Just Below the Surface – Is it About to Reaccelerate? by Tom Williams February 15, 2023, 06:49 33 Views 6 Votes 1 Comment The consensus forecast for the Consumer Price Index (CPI) was for +0.5% MoM in January, and that is what was reported despite hopes for better numbers. If you carry the numbers out to an extra decimal point on a YoY basis, the CPI would be 6.41%, down from 6.45% from the previous month. Hence, US inflation still remains at sticky highs. See this in the chart below and learn more here . The rise in Americans’ cost of living outpaced their income gains for the 22nd month in a row ( weekly earnings -1.5% YoY ). See this in the chart below. These are the Top 5 contributors to headline CPI (rising shelter costs stand out). See here the actual report from the BLS, which gives a further breakdown. It should be noted that prior to this inflation report, the BLS made its annual revisions. They made huge CPI revisions. If you thought prices were rising faster than the BLS said, you were right – learn more here and here . So where do we go from here concerning forecast inflation? If prices stay at current levels over time, MoM (month on month) and YoY (year on year) will eventually go to zero. But that would mean prices would not come down – they merely will not be continuing to advance. So let’s take a look at where we go from here by looking at our Money Value formula. The two key determinates of how the value of money is doing are GDP and the Monetary Base of the currency regime. Monetary Base can be grown or shrunk via Central Bank policy (amount of money printing, i.e., currency debasement) and government fiscal policy. Inflation is a by-product of Money Value. Below is a simplified formula to understand Money Value. Money Value = GDP / Monetary Base Let’s look at the denominator of this formula – the Monetary Base. It is marginally starting to cool off. See the Fed’s Monetary Base M2 measure in the chart below and learn more here . Looking at alternative data, we can see this slight decline in the Monetary Base as well. See this in the chart below and learn more here . Let’s also look at the numerator of this formula – GDP. Most forecasters show the GDP is near zero to slightly negative growth. See this in the chart below and learn more here . This means that the current trend shows that prices will level out at current levels, and the economy will have zero growth. However, though the current job numbers are not horrible today, they are beginning to trend down – see here . Other indicators, such as real estate, retail sales, PMIs, and trade balance, to name a few, are also trending down. This current stagnant economy has largely been engineered by Fed policy (higher interest rates and quantitative tightening) to cover up much of the Biden administration’s poor economic performance. As the economy continues to sink in the first half of 2023, the Fed will be forced to pivot and reverse its current policy at some point. The alternative will be a stagnant economy heading to a recession – perhaps a deep recession. How deep the recession will be dependent on how soon the Fed pivots. The point is that the Fed (government control) is what is driving the economy – and it is a largely political decision. Below is a fairly good summary video of what is happening to the global economy. Inflation is still very much a part of our economy. It lurks just below the surface. The more politically expedient move will be to print even more money, as many governments have done in history. Hence, this author believes that the next Fed move will be to pivot and turn back on the printing presses and expand the Monetary Base even further. Inflation starting at a rate that is at a higher level (i.e., the slope of increases that can go exponential) will make the next surge in inflation go even higher in 2023 than it did in 2022.

162,The rise of the Trump-Russia revisionists,Andrew Prokop,2023-02-15 11:30:00,"US President Donald Trump, right, attends a meeting with Russia’s President Vladimir Putin during the G20 summit in Osaka on June 28, 2019. | Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images The attempt to rewrite the Trump-Russia scandal is underway. But the critics leading the charge are showing their own blind spots. Nearly four years after the Mueller investigation concluded, the Trump-Russia scandal has largely faded from the nation’s political consciousness. The people who now dwell on it most are those who believe it was an appalling wrong committed against Donald Trump — or at the very least, a big embarrassment for the media and an overreach by investigators. Trump and his staunchest defenders on the right have long made the case that “Russiagate” was a sham, joined by some commentators like Glenn Greenwald and Matt Taibbi who aren’t professed Trump fans but who do disdain what they view as the groupthink, dishonesty, and partisanship of the media and liberal establishment. Late last month, this argument got its most prestigious endorsement yet, with the Columbia Journalism Review’s lengthy series by Jeff Gerth, titled “The press versus the president.” Gerth argued that major news outlets’ Trump-Russia coverage “includes serious flaws” and proceeded to lay out what he claimed those flaws were. Trump-Russia revisionism is on the rise and the old conventional wisdom is in retreat. Now that the scandal has faded from headlines and all those names and purportedly suspicious contacts have receded into the haze of memory, even liberals inclined to suspect the worst of Trump may be left wondering: What was that all about again, anyway? Did it really matter? I covered the investigation contemporaneously for Vox, and I do think a reassessment is worthwhile. But the revisionists tend to fall into their own patterns of oversimplification and overhype. Does the media’s Trump-Russia coverage hold up? It depends on what coverage you’re talking about. The “Trump as Manchurian candidate” theories, the frenzied hunt to unearth any suspicious-sounding “contacts” with any Russians, and anything based on the Steele dossier — the explosive document that purported to have the goods on Trump but very much didn’t — have not aged well. But the coverage and scandal were about more than that. Though it’s inconvenient for the revisionists’ narrative, the Russian government really did intervene in the 2016 election by hacking leading Democrats’ emails and having them leaked. Much of the coverage of the scandal now derided as “Russiagate” was about the investigation into whether anyone associated with Trump was involved in that Russian effort, treating this as an open question to which we simply didn’t yet know the answer. Much of what the critics are arguing here is less about the facts of the scandal and more about the larger narrative around it. Should the media have treated Trump-Russia as the biggest political story in the country? Did the overall amount and tone of the coverage leave a false impression of his guilt? How does it compare to scandal coverage of other politicians, like Hillary Clinton? And was the media and liberal establishment too suspicious of Trump in treating him like an unprecedented threat to the nation or have his subsequent actions proven they were right all along? The revisionists, in arguing that Trump got a raw deal, want to focus more attention on the overreaching of his liberal and establishment critics, but their one-sided account distorts the full picture of what happened, and reveals their own blind spots about the former president as he runs for office again. How the Trump-Russia story began Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images Donald Trump, flanked by campaign manager Paul Manafort and daughter Ivanka, checks the podium early Thursday afternoon in preparation for accepting the GOP nomination to be President at the 2016 Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio on Wednesday July 20, 2016. The revisionist account of how this all started is that it was mainly because of falsehoods spread by allies of Hillary Clinton. The narrative goes something like this: The Clinton campaign paid an opposition research firm, Fusion GPS, to research Trump’s Russia ties, and Fusion paid former British spy Christopher Steele to assemble what became known as his “dossier” of research claiming a vast Trump-Russia conspiracy — claims that, in their specifics, were largely later debunked as false. Various Clinton allies, and Steele himself, tried to get reporters to write about these claims, and law enforcement officials to investigate them. Later, Clinton allies also learned of a group of computer scientists’ research into whether a Trump server was communicating with Alfa Bank, a Russian bank, and tried to get that to investigators and the press too, but no wrongdoing was ever proven there. Gerth recounts this all in great detail. Now, all of this happened, and those particular claims about Trump and Russia indeed haven’t held up. But they are only one part of the story of how the Trump-Russia story began, and a relatively minor part. A fuller recap of what the scandal was all about would go something like this: What became the FBI’s investigation into Trump-Russia was opened in the summer of 2016 for reasons having nothing to do with Steele, Fusion, or Alfa Bank. That year, leading Democrats had seen their emails and documents stolen in hacks, later to surface on mysterious websites or to be published by WikiLeaks. Initial assessments blamed the Russian government for the hack (and Mueller’s team later confirmed those assessments, fleshing them out with much more detail). Trump viewed these leaks as highly beneficial to him, touting them constantly on the campaign trail, and even publicly calling on “Russia, if you’re listening” to find more Clinton emails. (He then claimed this was a joke, but in private, he urged his campaign advisers to try and get ahold of more Clinton emails.) While this was unfolding, the FBI received a tip that a little-known Trump foreign policy aide, George Papadopoulos, had been saying he knew Russia had damaging emails related to Clinton before any hack news was public. So the bureau opened a counterintelligence investigation originally focused on a discrete question: Had the Russian government conveyed information about their plans to interfere in the 2016 election to someone on Trump’s team? This was, I would argue, an entirely reasonable question. And with hindsight, due to this investigation and reporting, we know that many shenanigans were indeed afoot. Trump’s longtime adviser Roger Stone was trying to get hacked Democratic emails from WikiLeaks in advance, while apparently informing Trump about his efforts. Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort was sharing the campaign’s polling data and strategy with an associate the FBI claims is tied to Russian intelligence. Trump’s personal attorney, Michael Cohen, had reached out to the Russian government to try to get a Trump Tower Moscow project going, though it didn’t end up happening. Donald Trump Jr. even welcomed an emailed offer of dirt on Hillary Clinton that was said to be “part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump,” setting up a meeting with Manafort and Jared Kushner to discuss it. (They didn’t find the information useful.) Additionally, Trump later tried to get a different foreign government to help him win the 2020 election, in his effort to strong-arm Ukrainian president Volodymr Zelenskyy into investigating the Biden family — so it’s not like he’s ethically opposed to colluding with a foreign government to help him win the presidency. And here’s the other thing: Before the 2016 election, Trump-Russia was a minor subplot of the campaign coverage. The Clinton campaign tried to make the scandal catch on, but they didn’t yet succeed. There were occasional stories based on Fusion or Steele’s claims, but there was widespread skepticism of those claims (including here at Vox). When the New York Times did learn of the Trump-Russia investigation, they suggested there was not much to it, in an October 31 story headlined “Investigating Donald Trump, F.B.I. Sees No Clear Link to Russia” that poured cold water on the Alfa Bank claims. Indeed, Clinton’s own scandals and other Trump controversies received far more attention before Election Day. After the 2016 election, though, quite a bit changed. Mistakes were made Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images US President Donald Trump, left, shakes hands with FBI Director James Comey during an Inaugural Law Enforcement Officers and First Responders Reception in the Blue Room of the White House in Washington, DC, on January 22, 2017. Trump’s unexpected victory led mainstream media organizations and federal investigators to elevate the question of Russian interference to paramount importance — with suspicions running high. The public discussion around Trump and Russia then metamorphosed into something far more sprawling, strange, and conspiratorial, centering around the question of whether Trump was either “compromised” by Russia or was somehow a puppet of the Kremlin — a question even some top political players seriously entertained. This is the moment when Steele’s work had the greatest impact. Without him, “Manchurian candidate” theories may have been limited to self-appointed online gurus spinning elaborate fanfiction. But the dossier circulated in Washington, Comey briefed President-elect Trump on it, and then BuzzFeed News controversially decided to publish it in January 2017. Steele’s memos cited anonymous sources who laid out a maximalist version of Trump-Russia collusion, claiming he traded policy concessions on Ukraine in exchange for Russia’s email hacking; that his aides even helped pay the hackers; and that he had been exchanging information with Russian intelligence for “at least eight years.” Steele’s memos also fingered another little-known Trump foreign policy adviser, Carter Page, as orchestrating a wild collusion conspiracy with the Russian government. The memos also brought to life one of the most bizarre subplots of the whole affair: the pee tape. This was the claim that Trump hired prostitutes to “perform a ‘golden showers’ (urination) show in front of him” at the Moscow Ritz-Carlton in 2013, implying this could have been secretly taped so that Trump was vulnerable to Kremlin blackmail. Later investigations revealed, though, that most of Steele’s juicy claims came from one person who didn’t seem to have good intel or even believe in his own findings. Now, all along, most media coverage did make clear it wasn’t known whether Steele’s claims were true. However, once the dossier was published by BuzzFeed and those claims became public, they were frequently discussed as though they could well be true: On the one hand, Steele says this, on the other, Trump denies it, so who will you believe? In effect, this kind of framing did legitimize Steele’s claims far beyond what they deserved, letting unsubstantiated rumors and gossip drive coverage. And some media outlets and journalists were more Steele-friendly than others. There was regular discussion of his allegations on cable news, and a drumbeat of articles that kept asserting that more of his claims were being confirmed when they weren’t. (Paradoxically, Steele’s claims also effectively raised the bar for what “counted” as Trump-Russia collusion, making even the absurd seem within the realm of possibility, and setting up the less spectacular reality to later seem underwhelming in comparison.) Still, the revisionists too rarely acknowledge that many other media outlets, including the New York Times and the Washington Post, were more cautious about Steele’s claims, and about theories of Trump being Putin’s puppet. Much of their coverage of the Trump-Russia investigation and the topic generally was newsworthy and stuck to the facts, making clear that it wasn’t known whether Trump conspired with the Kremlin. Was the coverage perfect? No. There are some types of stories that have held up less well, including two in particular that are frequently criticized by the revisionists. The first is a genre that was briefly in vogue: the “Russian contacts” story. Fed by anonymous leaks, these stories were about how one Trump associate or another had talked with a Russian at some time, with the ominous implication that these contacts could be crucial to uncovering a conspiracy. But sometimes, these anonymous sources were incorrect. Gerth cites real-time internal commentary from the FBI’s Peter Strzok critiquing a series of these 2017 New York Times articles as “largely wrong.” And even when the contacts were real, further details revealed them to be not so sinister. For instance, it now seems clear Jeff Sessions was not hiding a secret conspiracy when he didn’t mention in Senate testimony that he met with the Russian ambassador once in his Senate office and also spoke to him briefly at a separate event. The second genre that proved hyperbolic is Russian trolls coverage. As I’ve written, the panic over online Russian trolls influencing Americans and swinging the 2016 election with propaganda or fake news was overhyped. Yes, this trolling operation existed, and its existence was newsworthy. But the overwhelming amount of coverage may have led to exaggerated perceptions of its impact which, as a recent study confirms, was pretty minimal. A question of suspicion Timothy A. Clary/AFP via Getty Images US President-elect Donald Trump waves to the crowd after leaving a meeting at the New York Times on November 22, 2016, in New York. But the revisionists’ issue with Trump-Russia coverage isn’t just about the stories that were factually wrong. It’s about something bigger, broader, and a bit tougher to pin down: the “narrative.” Media coverage that is accurate and even arguably justified can create an unfair or misleading narrative, due less to the facts than to proportion, hype, tone, and implication. For instance, leading media outlets did not merely cover Trump-Russia — they made an editorial choice to treat it as the biggest and most important political story of 2017 and 2018. New York Times executive editor Dean Baquet referred to the scandal internally as “Chapter 1 of the story of Donald Trump, not only for our newsroom but, frankly, for our readers,” per a transcript of a 2019 Times town hall. This was, in many respects, a defensible decision. This was the investigation that seemed like it could bring down the president or at least lead to his impeachment. We now know that it didn’t, but hindsight is 20/20. The core question of whether Trump worked with Russia, if you believed it was unsettled, was important. And as Baquet suggests, in a sense they were following intense reader interest as well (as I know very well, being privy to the traffic statistics for many of Vox’s Trump-Russia stories from that period). It was always going to get coverage — a lot of coverage. Another question posed by the revisionists is whether the overall tone and tenor of the coverage was too suspicious of Trump, and whether media outlets were too quick to assume he had something to hide. But recall that Trump fired the FBI director and then quickly contradicted his own aides’ explanation for why he did so, saying it was because of “the Russia thing.” Should the assumption have been that Trump had nothing to hide? (Gerth puts great weight on Trump also saying that he thought the firing actually might prolong the Russia investigation, ignoring the false explanation Trump’s team initially offered for Comey’s firing and sounding rather too credulous about whether Trump truly would have let such an investigation proceed.) These tensions are inherent to modern political scandal coverage. For decades, the press’s model has been Watergate, in which reporting and investigation gradually, in drip-drip-drip fashion, revealed a dastardly cover-up and brought down the president. Scandal coverage is internally and externally prestigious; it wins prizes and makes reporters famous. It sells. For this reason, Gerth was an interesting choice to write the Columbia Journalism Review’s Trump-Russia retrospective. He is the reporter who, his critics charge, invented the Whitewater scandal: the claims of wrongdoing over an Arkansas land deal that dogged Bill and Hillary Clinton for years and spurred the appointment of an independent counsel, a long investigation, and (years later) Bill Clinton’s impeachment on an unrelated matter. Gerth’s Times-era reporting on other topics, too, including the series that won him his Pulitzer, faced criticism for making ominous implications that were not borne out. (Semafor’s Ben Smith even reports that Gerth sent what sounds like a rather wildly speculative memo about the Clintons to the Times in 2016.) In the CJR series — which in my view makes some persuasive points but is overall a selective and one-sided account — Gerth does not reflect on any lessons he may have learned from his own work in the Clinton years. But back in 2015, my then-colleague Jonathan Allen wrote about what he called “the Clinton rules” — the unspoken assumptions that pervaded the mainstream media’s longtime approach to coverage of Bill and Hillary Clinton. Three of those rules, in his telling, were: 1) Everything, no matter how ludicrous-sounding, is worthy of a full investigation by federal agencies, Congress, the “vast right-wing conspiracy,” and mainstream media outlets. 2) Every allegation, no matter how ludicrous, is believable until it can be proven completely and utterly false. And even then, it keeps a life of its own in the conservative media world. 3) The media assumes that Clinton is acting in bad faith until there’s hard evidence otherwise. Part of this, Allen acknowledged, was due to a general journalistic desire to “comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable.” But, he added, there was another reason: “The Clinton rules are driven by reporters’ and editors’ desire to score the ultimate prize in contemporary journalism: the scoop that brings down Hillary Clinton and her family’s political empire.” Election night 2016 marked the shift from the Clinton rules to the Trump rules. But the reality is that when journalists come to the conclusion that a politician is fundamentally untrustworthy and trying to hide things, they tend to make a great effort to try to uncover those things — and sometimes they overreach in doing so. How should the media cover these unfolding investigations when information about them is incomplete and imperfect and the full story really isn’t initially clear? How much coverage is too much and how much is not enough? Can the press really know in advance which investigation is a nothingburger and which isn’t? These are tough questions with no easy answers. Coverage of Trump was fraught for another reason. Much of the media, the government, and the Democratic Party really did view him as a uniquely dangerous figure, an aspiring dictator with no ethical guardrails who would do anything to get and hold on to power. Were they right to suspect the worst of him? The revisionists have argued for years that they were wrong — that, driven by hysteria and partisanship, the liberal establishment exaggerated the threat Trump posed and that the real story was their own abuses of power. And as the Trump presidency settled into something like a routine and he seemed generally contained and constrained by his own administration and the sky didn’t fall, this may have seemed at least arguable. But Trump’s behavior after the 2020 election torpedoed that defense, laying his character bare and revealing that, yes, he really was willing to go to shocking lengths to hold on to power. Knowing that, it hardly seems unreasonable for the press to have responded to his denials of Russian collusion with skepticism and to investigate whether it happened. To be clear, there was too much hysterical and flawed reporting in Trump-Russia coverage, and that shouldn’t be defended. But a great deal of thoughtful, rigorous, and newsworthy work took place on that beat too. Journalists did not in the end find that Trump cut a deal with the Kremlin in 2016, but they unearthed a great deal about Trump and his allies in the process. Dismissing the whole thing as a hoax or debacle — as the revisionists are doing — is too pat a dismissal. It was a complicated, messy endeavor in a complicated, messy time.",politics,162

164,The new Congress is enlisting kids in its ongoing fight with Big Tech,Sara Morrison,2023-02-15 11:10:00,"Sens. Lindsey Graham, left, and Richard Blumenthal are behind EARN IT, one of several recent online safety bills for children. | Drew Angerer/Getty Images The latest salvo in reining in tech platforms: Laws to protect children from them. It looks like the big bipartisan push against Big Tech in the new Congress will be about protecting kids. While antitrust and privacy efforts seem to be languishing for now, several child-focused online safety bills are being introduced this session. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has reportedly signaled that passing them is a priority for him. President Joe Biden recently said the same. And they just might pass, if this week’s Senate Judiciary Committee hearing about protecting children online is any indication. Witnesses testified about how children are harmed by online content and the platforms that help push it to a largely friendly audience of senators, some of whom authored prominent child online safety bills in previous sessions. None have become law, but the new Congress seems intent on making it happen. For several years now, there’s been a bicameral and bipartisan consensus in Congress that something has to be done about Big Tech’s power, but not what nor how. Democrats and Republicans can’t even agree on whether Big Tech platforms moderate content too much or not enough. Now, it looks like they’ve found their cause and their victims: children. The desire to protect kids from internet harms and abuses is stronger than ever in the 118th Congress, making it increasingly likely that at least one law that purports to do so actually gets passed. But critics say that, in practice, those bills may not help children, and may exist at the expense of free speech and privacy. In the Tuesday hearing, Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) indicated that he is working with Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) to reintroduce EARN IT, an act from the last Congress that would remove Section 230 protections from online services that didn’t follow a list of best practices. Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) said that she and Sen. Blumenthal will be reintroducing the Kids Online Safety Act, or KOSA, which would have given children under 16 tools to prevent the amplification of harmful content on social media platforms and their parents the ability to limit their kids’ usage of those platforms. “New Congress, a new start on this,” Blackburn said. And Sen. Blumenthal, along with Judiciary Committee chair Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL) and Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-HI) also just reintroduced the Clean Slate for Kids Online Act, which would require that websites delete data collected from children under 13 upon their request. This week’s hearing wasn’t the only indication that children’s safety online is a priority for the new Congress. Schumer reportedly wants a vote on children’s online protection bills this summer. And while his administration is also pushing for such a law, President Biden had a few things to say about kids and the internet in his recent State of the Union address. “We must finally hold social media companies accountable for the experiment they are running on our children for profit,” he said. “And it’s time to pass bipartisan legislation to stop Big Tech from collecting personal data on kids and teenagers online.” “Ban targeted advertising to children!” Biden shouted over the applause. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) is talking about this, too. In a call with reporters on Monday, the new ranking member of the Senate Commerce Committee said that while his main focus when it comes to Big Tech legislation is on stopping content moderation that he believes harms free speech, he is talking to Senate Commerce Committee Chair Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA) about a privacy law. There is bipartisan support for privacy laws, Cruz said, and the ones that target children are the most likely to actually get anywhere this session. “That’s the easiest place to get bipartisan agreement,” Cruz said. “A comprehensive privacy bill is going to be a lot harder to bring together Democrats and Republicans.” As Cruz said, when it comes to bills that are framed as protecting children online, there’s reason to be optimistic that they’ll actually pass. We have precedent: The only federal consumer internet privacy law we have is the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act. Then there’s Section 230, which gives online platforms immunity over content posted by their users. This pivotal protection was originally part of the Communications Decency Act, which was meant to stop kids from seeing porn online. Other parts of that law were later struck down, but Section 230 remains (as does online porn). But all this apparent support still doesn’t mean the bills are slam dunks to become law. Biden’s State of the Union comments were very close to what he said at the State of the Union address a year ago, and that didn’t seem to help EARN IT, KOSA, and Clean Slate pass. So there’s no guarantee that those bills will fare any better in this session, but there is some new pressure for them to do so: States are now passing their own children’s protection online laws in lieu of federal action. California’s Age-Appropriate Design Code Act will take effect in 2024. The law forces online services that are likely to be accessed by people under 18 to get permission before collecting their data, and it bans them from using that data in certain ways. Basically, websites have to be designed to give users under 18 the most privacy possible. California’s legislation is modeled on a United Kingdom law with the same name. Several states are considering similar laws. Not everyone is on board with protecting children this way, however. Internet privacy and free speech advocates have criticized KOSA and EARN IT, saying that the laws may actually do the opposite of what their supporters claim. EARN IT, opponents say, could force services to drop encryption, exposing users’ communications to law enforcement (or anyone else who can get access to them) or make platforms monitor their own users’ public and private speech. They also say it won’t be an effective tool to fight child sexual abuse material, which is its supposed purpose. Critics of KOSA believe that the legislation would make censorship on platforms worse, and that it’s sure to be overbroad, because platforms won’t want to risk allowing anything that might get them in trouble. Also, they believe KOSA gives parents too much power over what their children (specifically, teenagers) can see and do, and might force platforms to create age verification systems that would hurt everyone’s privacy, as all users would have to submit personal information to a third party to prove their age just to use a service. The other danger in child-targeted laws like this is that Congress will just stop there. History shows us that once children are legally protected, lawmakers will punt on extending those protections to adults. They may even punt on additional laws for children. The Communications Decency Act and the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act passed more than 25 years ago. Technology has changed a lot since then. Laws didn’t. A bill that restricts some of the biggest companies in the world is a hard sell for some politicians, as evidenced by the foot-dragging to pass bipartisan and bicameral antitrust and privacy bills last year. A bill that is said to protect children, on the other hand, is hard to vote against. But those bills may do more harm than good. They also give lawmakers a way to look like they’re doing something about online harm for some people without having to do the harder work of figuring out how to give those protections to everyone.",politics,164
165,"Tesla to open part of charging network to other EVs, as Biden officials announce latest steps in expansion of charging stations",I,2023-02-15 10:27:00,"Biden administration officials announced a significant step Wednesday in moving the U.S. toward a more expansive and cohesive network of EV charging stations. Part of the move includes a major concession from EV market leader Tesla, which owns and operates an extensive network of proprietary ""superchargers"" for its cars. But now, White House infrastructure coordinator Mitch Landrieu says the Elon Musk-led company has agreed to open part of its charging network to non-Tesla vehicles. ""These recent and new commitments will make more public chargers available for all EVs,"" Landrieu said Tuesday on a background call with reporters. ""With announcements like today's and the overall growth we're seeing, it's clear that this administration is making incredible progress towards building our electric future."" Some $7.5 billion from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will be spent on building out a network of 500,000 EV chargers across the country. A key requirement for EV chargers backed by federal funding is that they must provide charging access for any electric vehicle. Had Tesla opted to limit the use of its supercharger network to Tesla's with its proprietary connector, it would have been ineligible to receive federal funds to expand its network with government support. A White House official confirmed that Tesla will be able to obtain federal funds for some 7,500 chargers that it expects to open up to non-Tesla vehicles by the end of 2024. Those chargers will have to be outfitted with adapter connections to allow any EV to use the chargers. Landrieu added that the White House has been in contact with Tesla and other companies in coordinating plans to build out the EV charging network. The announcement also included partnerships between GM and EV charging station company FLO to construct up to 40,000 Level 2 chargers, along with a deal between Hertz and BP to build out charging stations at Hertz locations in major cities. Other automakers like Ford, Mercedes and Volvo are also supporting the effort either through partnerships or direct investments. In all, the White House says some 100,000 public chargers will begin to be added across the country beginning as soon as 2024, as result of the announced plans. One goal is to ensure that EV drivers will have the ability to drive across the country and easily find a reliable charger. It's a goal that remains a challenge for many EV drivers. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg says ease of use is a major priority for the construction of the charging network. ""No matter what EV you drive, we want to make sure that you will be able to plug in [knowing] the price that you're going to be paying and charge up with a predictable and user-friendly experience,"" said Buttigieg, who was also on the background call with Landrieu. ""Just as when you are filling up with gas today, you know that the experience will be broadly consistent, regardless of your location and regardless of the vendor,"" he added. Officials on the call also outlined a ""build America, buy America"" requirement for EV chargers supported with federal funds that mandates manufacturers ensure final assembly of the chargers takes place within the U.S. By July of next year, builders will also need to ensure that 55% of component costs are sourced domestically as well. The new development comes as the White House works to ramp up its clean energy priorities that would call for spending billions in funding and incentives for states, businesses and consumers in order to curb greenhouse gas emissions. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act includes $7.5 billion in funding for EV charging, $10 billion for clean transportation, along with $7 billion for battery components for EVs. Buyers of new and used EVs could also receive a key tax credit funded by the Inflation Reduction Act, which includes $369 billion to fund projects aimed at reducing the effects of climate change. The Biden administration has set a goal for EVs to make up half of all vehicles sales in the U.S. by 2030 and to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.",politics,165
166,Fox Guest Throws Unhinged Sexist Tantrum Over Chelsea Handler's Childlessness,I,2023-02-15 04:20:28,"Chelsea Handler celebrated being childless in a comedy skit last week, and it has really upset some men on Fox News . On Tuesday, Tucker Carlson and his guest, conservative radio host Jesse Kelly, threw a fit over the comedian’s video for “ The Daily Show .” In the clip, the 47-year-old enjoyed “a day in the life of a childless woman,” which included a whole lot of doing “whatever the fuck I feel like.” Advertisement Carlson said the point of Handler’s video was to “make you feel good about being an aging, deeply unlikable woman who never had kids.” Kelly saw Carlson’s misogyny and raised it, complaining that “feminists like Chelsea Handler” had been lied to by society that “you can be a girl boss and you can do anything a man can do.” “Which everyone who’s ever seen a woman back up a vehicle knows that’s not true,” he added. This sexist rant is so unbelievably unhinged. I literally watch Tucker Carlson as my job and even I'm sitting here like, ""Jesus Christ, dude."" pic.twitter.com/eEEKGKBQGc — Kat Abu (@abughazalehkat) February 15, 2023 Kelly then blamed society for leading women to believe they can enjoy fulfilling lives without procreating. Advertisement “They’ve been told that they should do career and don’t do a family or anything like that,” he continued. “And soon you’re Chelsea Handler ... and your Valentine’s Day date for the 10th year in a row is a 10-year-old copy of ‘Magic Mike’ and a half-full bottle of Xanax and you’re trying to pretend like you’re happy, but you’re not happy. “It’s actually not her fault. She’s been lied to by a country that has lost his way.” The segment may have served as retaliation for one of Handler’s monologues while she was guest host last week of “The Daily Show,” when she joked about the way “motherhood is treated as a woman’s essential purpose in life, as if our destiny is to let a tiny stranger rip a hole through our Pikachu from the inside out.” In her roast, she included a clip of a different misogynistic rant on “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” In it, Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio) complained to Carlson that progressive Democrats were “a bunch of childless cat ladies” destroying the country. “Maybe if you two weren’t such boner killers, women would want to have more children,” Handler said. In a separate monologue, Handler wondered why Carlson was such a “whiny little bitch.” Carlson makes a habit of spouting and elevating unvarnished sexism on his show, including his observation in 2021 that COVID-19 “feminizes” and emasculates men because it makes them weaker. Earlier that year, he earned rebukes from the military after he complained that pregnant women serving in the armed forces were “making a mockery of the U.S. military.” Advertisement In 2019, the nonprofit watchdog group Media Matters dug up a series of comments Carlson made from 2006 to 2011 on talk radio, which included him describing women as “extremely primitive” and “like dogs.” Related tucker carlson misogyny Chelsea Handler childless by choice Tucker Carlson's Alien-Invasion Swipe At Biden And Harris Is Universally Dumb 'Daily Show' Guest Host Chelsea Handler Burns 'Whiny Little B**ch' Tucker Carlson Tucker Carlson Goes To A Dark Place In Weird New Attack On Democrats Go To Homepage Before You Go Josephine Harvey Senior Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Dianne Feinstein first held elected office on the Board of Supervisors in San Francisco in 1969, then became the first woman to be president of the board in the 1970s. The course of her political career drastically shifted in 1978 as she announced the assassinations of then-mayor George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk. Feinstein became mayor in the aftermath, a position she held for the next 10 years. ""Diane Feinstein has been incredibly significant in this city pre-mayorship, post-mayorship,"" said former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown. He was serving in the California Assembly as Feinstein was gaining political momentum in San Francisco. ""I know that at all times Dianne would do what she thinks is in the best interest of public policy making,"" said Brown. ALSO READ: 'A legend' - Tributes pour in for Sen. Dianne Feinstein after she announces retirem During the AIDS crisis, then-Mayor Feinstein earmarked $3.5 million dollars for the city's AIDS budget, which was more than President Reagan allocated for the entire country. In 1990 Feinstein ran unsuccessfully for Governor of California against Pete Wilson, then two years later exploded onto the national scene winning her bid for Senate in 1992 - a position she's held ever since. ""Diane always was and always will be probably the most viable, sensible politician on the democratic side to run statewide,"" said Brown. In 1992, Feinstein and former California Sen. Barbara Boxer made history by both getting elected to the U.S. Senate. Boxer said she will never forget the way Feinstein helped her during that Senate run. ""The prejudice [against women] was just ridiculous,"" said Boxer. ""People would say to me, 'Well, I'm voting for Dianne. I just couldn't vote for another woman, though.'"" Boxer says she remembers Feinstein mostly for her tenacity, especially when it came to her tireless push for the 1994 assault weapons ban -- something that was not particularly politically popular when it was first proposed. ent ""She never gave up and everyone said, oh you'll never get the votes, you'll never, the NRA is against you, and I was there in so many of those meetings where she said we're not giving up,"" Boxer said.

""Her lifetime of service and leadership has made out country fairer, safer and stronger, and I am proud to call her a mentor and a friend. California and the nation owe Senator Feinstein a deep debt of gratitude."" ALSO READ: 'A legend' - Tributes pour in for Sen. Dianne Feinstein after she announces retirement Feinstein's upcoming retirement will mark the end of a decades-long career in politics, which began on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1969. She first gained national prominence in the dark hours following the 1978 City Hall assassinations of San Francisco Mayor George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk. Feinstein succeeded Moscone as interim mayor and then became the first woman elected to serve in that position. Feinstein's three-decade run in the Senate began after she won a 1992 special election to fill the seat vacated by Pete Wilson, who was elected governor of California in 1990. She was subsequently re-elected in 1994, 2000, 2006, 2012 and 2018. In November 2022, Feinstein eclipsed former Sen. Barbara Mikulski for the historic distinction of being the longest-serving woman ever in the U.S. Senate. ""It's an incredible honor to become the longest-serving woman senator in our nation's history, and I'm forever grateful to the people of California who sent me here to represent them,"" she said in a news release at the time. However, 2022 was also the year she lost her 86-year-old husband, Richard Blum, to a long battle with cancer. In her announcement, Feinstein indicated she would continue to focus during the remainder of her term on the issues she campaigned on, including the effects of climate change, homelessness, health care, and the scourge of gun violence. ""Congress has enacted legislation on all of these topics over the past several years, but more needs to be done - and I will continue these efforts,"" said Feinstein. ""I also remain focused on passing commonsense legislation to fight the epidemic of gun violence, preserving our pristine lands and promoting economic growth - especially to position California for what I believe will be the century of the Pacific. And I will use my seniority on the Appropriations Committee to ensure California gets its fair share of funding. ""I'm confident we can achieve these goals because we've done it before. From the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban to the 2014 CIA torture report, from preserving Lake Tahoe and the Mojave Desert to passing the first significant global warming legislation, from protecting student athletes from abuse to protecting consumers from harmful chemicals, and more recently improving our efforts to combat wildfire and drought, we have improved the lives of millions. The fight for the safely Democratic seat held by Feinstein, who at 89 is the oldest member of Congress, is shaping up as a marquee match-up between nationally known rivals and is likely to become one of the most expensive Senate races in the country next year. On Saturday, Democratic U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff, who rose to prominence as the lead prosecutor in former President Donald Trump's first impeachment trial, gathered hundreds of supporters in a union hall parking lot for a rally in his hometown of Burbank, California, where he implored the cheering crowd, ""Let's go win this thing."" Schiff, who announced his candidacy last month, said he was running for Senate after two decades in Congress ""to build an economy that works for everyone, a democracy that will last for all time and a planet that doesn't melt beneath our feet."" A day earlier, Democratic U.S. Rep. Katie Porter brought her Senate campaign to Los Angeles, where she met with local leaders to discuss pollution in lower-income neighborhoods. She said such areas are often overlooked in Washington and Sacramento, where residents' complaints about unhealthy conditions go unheard. Porter, a leader in Congress' progressive wing, built a reputation for her tough questioning of CEOs and other witnesses at congressional hearings - often using a whiteboard to break down information. Other potential contenders for the seat include Democratic Rep. Barbara Lee, a former chair of the Congressional Black Caucus. If she runs and is elected, Lee would be the only Black woman in the Senate.",politics,169
170,The MSU Shooting Is Making Us See A New Kind Of Gun Tragedy,I,2023-02-15 02:10:15,"DETROIT — The toll of Monday night’s massacre at Michigan State University , where three students died and five others suffered grievous wounds, is going to be felt in these parts for a long time. Arielle Anderson, a sophomore, wanted to become a pediatric doctor. Brian Fraser, also a sophomore, was president of his fraternity. Alexandria Verner was a junior and a three-sport athlete in high school. Advertisement That’s three lives cut short, five more who carry around the scars forever, plus countless more who will deal with emotional trauma that is no longer unusual in American life. But, usually, that experience is a novel one. For a handful on Monday, it wasn’t. Among the students at MSU were several who were at Oxford High School , north of Detroit, where a gunman killed four and wounded seven others in late 2021 . One texted her mother, according to an account in the Detroit Free Press, and said “Mom, I just want to come home, I want to hold you.” That was to be expected, perhaps, given that MSU’s student body includes graduates from virtually every major public high school in Michigan. But it wasn’t just Oxford alumni reliving that kind of trauma. People leave flowers, mourn and pray at a makeshift memorial at ""The Rock"" on the campus of Michigan State University on Feb. 14, 2023. A gunman opened fire at two locations on the campus the day prior, killing three students and injuring several others. Scott Olson via Getty Images Advertisement Among those currently attending MSU is Jackie Matthews , a senior who lived through the Sandy Hook Elementary massacre in Newtown, Connecticut, 10 years ago. A little after midnight, in a room across the street from where the shooting took place, she put her thoughts into a TikTok video . “I am 21 years old, and this is the second mass shooting that I have now lived through,” Matthews said. She went on to describe her memories of Sandy Hook ― of crouching under desks with her classmates for so long that she actually fractured vertebrae, an injury that to this day flares up when she’s under stress. “The fact that this is the second mass shooting that I have now lived through is incomprehensible,” she added. Incomprehensible ― except, again, maybe it’s not so incomprehensible. MSU has 50,000 students , many of them from outside Michigan. It’s not all that surprising to find some who survived prior school shootings, given how common they’ve become, to say nothing of students whose lives gun violence has touched in some other way. Every day in America, 22 children and teens are the victims of gun violence , according to the Brady organization . That number includes homicides and suicides, attempted and successful, sometimes in the course of other crimes and sometimes as singular acts. Advertisement Matthews ended her TikTok with a plea for action. “We can no longer just provide love and prayers,” she said. “It needs to be legislation.” So will there be? America’s Gun Violence Problem Is Unique The case for action is strong. No other economically advanced country has so many firearm deaths or so many firearms in civilian hands. And there’s no mystery why guns here are so prevalent: It’s much easier to obtain and possess them. Whether that easy access was a factor in the MSU shootings remains to be seen, with details of the incident and the alleged perpetrator still emerging. He was a 43-year-old man who died hours after the killings, apparently after shooting himself. He had a prior misdemeanor conviction that, according to the Free Press , his lawyers pleaded down from a more serious felony gun charge, which may have been enough to make possession legal in his case. Michigan State University students react during an active shooter situation on campus on Feb. 13, 2023, in East Lansing, Michigan. Bill Pugliano via Getty Images Advertisement Neighbors described the man as a “loner” who had difficult relations with family members, according to several media accounts, and recalled the sound of him taking target practice with an automatic weapon in the yard. The shooter’s father has told reporters he asked his son whether he had a gun in the house, and the son denied it. The full accounting of what happened may end up strengthening the case for more aggressive prosecution of gun crimes. The story could also be another argument in favor of more investment in mental health care. But inconsistent prosecution of crime and high prevalence of mental illness are not uniquely American phenomena. Only the high number of guns and gun crimes are. There’s no reason lawmakers can’t address all of those at once — which, to be clear, doesn’t mean they will. Advertisement A History Of (Mostly) Futile Legislative Efforts For nearly a quarter-century now, demands for action have followed every mass shooting, going back to the Columbine High School massacre near Denver, Colorado, in 1999 and then Sandy Hook in 2012 ― after which President Barack Obama, speaking as a father as much as a president, teared up while vowing to enact new legislation. He didn’t succeed , even though it was just months after he’d won a resounding reelection bid and even though polls showed the public behind him ― and even though, in the Senate, a compromise bill from Sens. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Pat Toomey (R-Penn.) had support from most Democrats and a few Republicans as well. It was a modest package focusing on background checks, scaled way back from what Obama had originally proposed. But even those concessions weren’t enough to pry the votes necessary to prevail in a chamber where rural, more conservative states have disproportionate power ― and where, then as now, it took a supermajority of 60 votes to pass legislation. One of the few exceptions took place last year, when the outrage over yet another massacre of small children ― this time in Uvalde, Texas ― led to a bipartisan gun bill that President Joe Biden signed. The law strengthens the existing background check system and seeks to cut down on so-called “straw purchases,” while putting money into mental health services . That bill also provides states with funding for “ red flag laws ,” which set up a legal process for taking guns away from somebody that loved ones can demonstrate is a danger to others or themselves. (These are known as “extreme protection orders.”) Advertisement President Barack Obama wipes tears as he makes a statement in response to the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, on Dec. 14, 2012. Alex Wong via Getty Images But enactment of that legislation took place against the backdrop of a landmark Supreme Court decision striking down a New York law restricting the ability to carry a gun in public ― and, with it, jeopardizing similar laws on the books across the country. It was an extension of earlier decisions protecting a constitutional right to personal gun ownership, something the Supreme Court didn’t even recognize until 2008 , and just this month two separate federal judges have cited that ruling as a reason to throw out state laws prohibiting gun possession by people who are subject to domestic violence orders. Gun Legislation Finally Has A Chance In Michigan Here in Michigan , passing gun laws has also been a struggle . After the Oxford shooting, Democrats in the state legislature proposed a series of measures ― to create a more comprehensive background check system, to set new rules for gun storage and to set up a red flag system. Republican leaders in the legislature would not even give the proposals a hearing in committee. That was possible because they’d dismissed previous efforts with no political consequences, thanks in part to support from gun rights advocacy groups and a deeply partisan gerrymander that gave Republicans an effective lock on control. But that gerrymander ended when Michigan voters approved an initiative to create a nonpartisan redistricting commission, and with those new districts in place, Democrats won control of the legislature for the first time since the 1980s.

My official statement regarding the Michigan State University shooting is below: Fuck your thoughts and prayers. pic.twitter.com/iHCOxOmDA3 — Rep. Ranjeev Puri (@RanjeevPuri) February 14, 2023 Even before Monday’s shooting, Democratic leaders in the legislature had vowed to make those gun laws among their top priorities. After the shooting , they made clear they intended to press ahead ― and they didn’t mince words. “Fuck your thoughts and prayers,” tweeted Rep. Ranjeev Puri, a Democrat whose district is in the western Detroit suburbs. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer , the Democrat who won reelection in November, didn’t use the same colorful language at a Tuesday morning press conference. She didn’t even mention legislation explicitly. But she, too, has identified those gun proposals as a top priority , and she alluded to them in an emotional appearance when, like Obama 10 years ago, she had to hold back tears . Advertisement “This is a uniquely American problem,” said Whitmer, whose own kids now attend college in Michigan. “Our children are scared to go to school ... words are not good enough.” Evidence On Gun Laws Tells A Complex Story The tough question about these measures is just how much good they will do. The sheer number of guns now in circulation here in the U.S. means that gun violence is a reality that won’t go away easily. The most far-reaching response would be significant restrictions on gun ownership and possession, coupled with the kind of buyback that Australia launched following a high-profile massacre there. But that action has no prospect of passing Congress right now. Even if it did, it wouldn’t get past this Supreme Court. That leaves the kind of modest regulations now on the agenda in Michigan, among other states. The evidence of their effectiveness is more suggestive than dispositive, as Rand Corporation researchers have found in a series of widely cited literature reviews. One reason is that, until recently, federal restrictions on funding gun violence research meant it was difficult to conduct the kind of studies necessary. Those restrictions were the handiwork of National Rifle Association allies on Capitol Hill. But there’s enough research to suggest that some measures could make a difference . And it doesn’t take a ton of imagination to think a red flag law might have deterred the MSU shooter or others like him, especially if people were aware of the law. (That’s turned out to be a key issue in states that have passed these laws already: Not enough people know about them to make use of them.). Advertisement The main tradeoff of these systems is the process and scrutiny that prospective gun owners must go through and whether they represent an unforgivable infringement on liberty. The NRA and its supporters see it that way. So do plenty of elected officials, most of them Republican, still serving in Congress and state legislatures. But the majority of Americans don’t seem to agree. Ideas like background checks consistently draw high approval numbers in surveys, across partisan lines, including a poll of Michiganders that the firm EPIC-MRC released in September . Voters who support these measures may change their minds as the debate goes forward. It’s happened that way before. But it’s also possible the majority of Americans think liberty means the freedom to attend school without getting caught up in a massacre ― and then having to go through that experience all over again.

171,Oakland mayor talks public safety as suspension of police chief continues,I,2023-02-15 01:59:00,"OAKLAND – Mayor Sheng Thao joined Oakland police and community leaders Tuesday morning to announce some new public safety initiatives. As LeRonne Armstrong remains on forced leave , some are wondering if it spells bad news for the embattled police chief. Thao gathered business leaders and police brass to highlight public safety initiatives for downtown and business districts around the city. Most of the measures involving police already exist, like maintaining community liaison officers and the traffic enforcement unit to combat dangerous driving. There was one new thing. ""Starting next week, you will see the return of our walking officers to our businesses and neighborhood shopping districts,"" said acting chief Darren Allison. ""This is a unit that hasn't been in existence for the past two years, so this is an exciting time to expand our relationships in the business community and our neighborhoods."" That may come as welcome news to businesses along Broadway. They've been enduring brazen crime in their area for months and often complain about lack of police response. ALSO READ: Small business owners support embattled Oakland Police Chief LeRonne Armstrong ""In order for Oakland to thrive 365, we need to have OPD, we need to have our community policing, as well as the community, to help continue our businesses and the safety of our customers and employees and owners,"" said Alicia Kidd, owner of CoCo Noir wine bar in the downtown area. Perhaps the most glaring question at the news conference was who wasn't in the room Tuesday. Armstrong was put on forced administrative leave last month by Mayor Thao, and she once again declined to address the situation. ""There's no update,"" said Thao. ""Again, we're taking the investigation very seriously and you all will know when we get an update."" ALSO READ: 'It was shocking;' Suspended OPD Chief LeRonne Armstrong explains the battle over his job With the chief still out, and the mayor appearing with acting chief Allison to discuss new public safety initiatives, supporters of Armstrong, such as Chinatown leader Carl Chan, see a deeper message. ""At this moment, when our mayor's calling for the press conference, I can only think it's more of a political move than anything else,"" said Chan. Armstrong has strong—and vocal—support from many in the community who are demanding he be reinstated. Chan said they have gotten no further information from the Mayor's Office about the Chief, and he thinks Tuesday's press conference may be a signal that Thao plans to move on without Armstrong. ""It's just puzzling,"" said Chan, ""And people may be thinking, are you trying to work with the chief now, or are you going to be firing the chief? So, I think this is the question that we all want to know as soon as possible."" Armstrong was placed on paid administrative leave on January 19th after a federal monitor's report criticized him for his handling of an internal affairs case. That report has not been made public. As he remains off duty, Thao has said she is waiting for more information, but no one is quite sure what's left to investigate.",politics,171
172,"Under Shadow of MSU And Parkland, Biden Calls For Gun Control To End The Bloodshed",I,2023-02-15 00:10:13,"President Joe Biden reaffirmed his plea to Congress for tighter gun control laws Tuesday afternoon with separate statements released in response to the five-year anniversary of the Parkland shooting and Monday’s attack on a Michigan university. “Jill and I are praying for the three students killed and the five students fighting for their lives after last night’s shooting at Michigan State University,” he said in one statement . “Our hearts are with these young victims and their families, the broader East Lansing and Lansing communities, and all Americans across the country grieving as the result of gun violence.” The rampage came just one day before the anniversary of the 2018 school shooting in Parkland, Florida, that killed 17 people. “In the years since, more communities have been impacted by gun violence,” Biden wrote in his second statement . Advertisement Biden said that his administration is making progress on the implementation of a gun safety law that was enacted last year, and he announced $231 million in funding for 49 states and territories to support gun safety measures. Among those are “red flag” laws, which allow community members to obtain a court order to temporarily restrict firearm access for a potentially dangerous person. The money will also go toward “mental health and substance use treatment courts, and veterans’ treatment courts,” according to the president. “This funding will reduce gun violence and save lives,” he said. Elsewhere in the statements, Biden reiterated his call for Congress to pass “commonsense gun law reforms,” which he made part of his State of the Union address last week. “We have more work to do,” he wrote. The proposed measures would, among other things, outlaw military-style weapons and high-capacity magazines, impose background checks for all gun sales, and strip immunity from gun manufacturers “who knowingly put weapons of war on our streets.” Advertisement “Action is what we owe to those grieving today in Michigan and across America,” he said. Students hug during an active shooter situation at Michigan State University on Monday in Lansing, Michigan. Bill Pugliano via Getty Images On Monday night, a gunman opened fire at MSU, killing three people and wounding five others. Officials said Tuesday that the 43-year-old suspect , who had a previous firearms violation, eventually shot and killed himself following an hourslong manhunt. The man’s motive is still unknown, and officials have not yet provided details about the weapon or weapons used in the attack. At least 68 mass shootings have occurred so far in 2023, according to the Gun Violence Archive . In the years since the Parkland shooting, lawmakers have enacted hardly any significant legislation on gun reform. Following last year’s attacks in Uvalde, Texas, and Buffalo, New York, Congress passed a bipartisan bill that included modest restrictions on gun purchases, as well as funds aimed at improving mental health care and school security. The legislation also strengthened background checks for those under the age of 21 and restricted abusive domestic partners from obtaining firearms. Despite being the first gun violence prevention legislation passed at the federal level in 30 years, activists were dissatisfied with the law and have been campaigning for more reform in 2023 . The passage of new legislation is likely to be a long shot in both the Republican-dominated House and the Senate, where Democrats have a slim 51-seat majority.

174,Mitt Romney Issues Urgent Warning About Trump's Path To 2024 GOP Nomination,I,2023-02-14 22:09:55,"A large field of presidential contenders in 2024 could lead to a redo of the 2016 presidential race and help make Donald Trump the Republican presidential nominee once again, according to Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah). “The only way that [scenario] could be prevented is if it narrowed down to a two-person race eventually. That means donors and influencers say to their candidate ― if they’re weakening: ‘Hey, time to get out,’” Romney told HuffPost in an interview on Tuesday. Advertisement “Last time that was done was in 1968, so it’s been a while,” Romney added, referring to the 1968 presidential election in which his father George Romney took part. Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley on Tuesday became the first Republican to declare a candidacy for the White House after Trump, who launched his 2024 campaign in November. Haley, who also served as U.S. ambassador to the U.N. during Trump’s administration, called for “a new generation of leadership” in a video announcing her candidacy. Romney said he viewed Haley as an “underdog” in the race. Trump, the senator added, is “by far the most likely” to become the GOP presidential nominee given his popularity and name recognition with a devoted slice of the GOP electorate. (Romney is decidedly not a fan: He voted to convict Trump in two successive Senate impeachment trials). Trump is expected to face a crowded field of contenders for the GOP presidential nomination as he did during the 2016 election. In that race, a large roster of candidates split support among GOP voters and donors alike, leading to Trump clinching the nomination. Advertisement Much has been written about Trump’s “ diminished ” influence within the GOP, especially after his party’s weak performance in the 2022 midterm election. Polls show he’s still way on top when it comes to the race for the 2024 presidential nomination, but potential candidates like Florida GOP Gov. Ron Desantis are nipping at his heels. Although GOP leaders aren’t in a hurry to embrace a Trump 2024 run, he still has plenty of support on Capitol Hill, including from several newly-elected lawmakers. Sen. Markwayne Mullin (R-Okla.) last week became the fifth GOP senator to back Trump’s campaign, calling the man who sought to overturn democracy in the days leading up to the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol “exactly the president we need to lead this country through the tough road ahead.” Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.) said he believed the 2024 race will be “wide open” despite the fact that he’s backing Trump’s campaign. “President Trump is going to have a base of 25-30%. He’s got a lot of work to grow on that. DeSantis has built a name on conservative menus,” he said, adding that it’s “good for our party” if many candidates jump run and there is healthy competition for the presidential nomination. Trump has ramped up attacks against DeSantis, sharing wild accusations about the conservative heartthrob on his social media platform TruthSocial that suggested DeSantis was “ grooming high school girls with alcohol ” when he was a teacher. The former president has also been testing nicknames for DeSantis, including “Ron DeSantimonious” and “ Ron Meatball .” DeSantis has chosen to ignore the attacks, saying he isn’t focused on “smearing” fellow Republicans . Advertisement “That’s how he does things,” Tuberville told HuffPost when asked about Trump’s TruthSocial posts. “He tries to get a doll out of people. That’s probably what he did as a contractor in New York. You get into arguments, you complain, you fight with each other, and then you go to dinner at night. We’re all on the same team.” Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), who voted to convict Trump over the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, suggested that a large field of presidential candidates would narrow relatively quickly due to a lack of resources. “Although there might be a number of people who announce, how many people will have money? If you don’t have money, you can’t buy name recognition. If you can’t buy the name recognition, you falter early,” Cassidy said. Sen. Mike Braun (R-Ind.), who supported Trump in the past but who has held off on making another endorsement as he runs for governor in Indiana, predicted an eventual showdown between Trump and DeSantis. The Florida governor hasn’t yet announced whether he will launch a bid for the White House. “No one else is registering above one [percent]” in early polls of the race, Braun said. Democrats , meanwhile, are treating the odds of another showdown between Trump and President Joe Biden in the 2024 general election as quite serious, even though they believe it would ultimately benefit their party if last year’s midterm election results are any sign of Trump’s unpopularity with swing voters. Advertisement Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), the 2016 Democratic vice presidential nominee, said all signs were pointing again to the same dynamics that initially propelled Trump to the GOP presidential nomination. “A name ID edge in a multi-candidate field is even more powerful than a name ID edge in a two-candidate field,” Kaine said. “[Trump] was able to be in a lane of his own and then everybody else was competing in a non-Trump lane. I think that same dynamic could well hold in 2024.” “Each new entrant is going to make him happier and happier,” Kaine added of Trump and the 2024 GOP race.

175,Biden Administration Proposes Big Change To Benefits For People With Disabilities,I,2023-02-14 22:02:42,"WASHINGTON — A new proposal from the Social Security Administration would make life easier for millions of disabled Americans whose friends or family help them out with food. The proposal, set to be published Wednesday in the Federal Register , would make it so the government no longer cuts monthly benefits for people who get regular help with meals or groceries. Advertisement More than 7 million Americans with disabilities receive monthly payments from the Supplemental Security Income program, which has strict eligibility requirements that Congress hasn’t adjusted for decades. Beneficiaries give the government permission to monitor their bank accounts, and an application form on the Social Security Administration’s website asks if the applicant buys all their own food separately from household members or if somebody from outside the house helps them. The form says applicants “must report to Social Security” if the amount of help they receive from others “goes up or down,” and that they have to notify the government if someone starts helping them with expenses. The maximum SSI benefit is $914, but it can drop by a third, or $304, if someone else pays for a beneficiary’s food or rent. Roughly 10% of recipients faced a food or shelter reduction in January 2022, according to the Social Security Administration. Advertisement Under the proposed rule, rent help could still cause a benefit reduction, but food help wouldn’t. “We expect that these changes will simplify our rules, making them less cumbersome to administer and easier for the public to understand and follow,” the Social Security Administration said in its proposal. The proposed change likely reflects the priorities of President Joe Biden — under his Republican predecessor, the Social Security Administration pursued cuts to disability benefits. The change won’t take effect immediately; by law, the Social Security Administration has to wait for the public to comment and then respond to the feedback. The current rule discourages friends and family members from helping people with severe disabilities, said Jennifer Burdick, a legal aid lawyer with Community Legal Services of Philadelphia. “It’s administratively unwieldy and honestly mean-spirited to ask SSI recipients to report every free meal they receive and then cut their benefits in response,” Burdick said. Advertisement David Goldfarb, director of policy for The Arc, an organization that advocates for people with disabilities, said he hoped the Social Security Administration would consider simplifying the rest of its “in-kind support and maintenance” calculation. “For example, if someone is sleeping on a friend’s couch or floor, which has no market value in terms of rent, I don’t think that should be included in these calculations either,” Goldfarb said. Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) has described SSI as a “forgotten” program since Congress has let it run on autopilot for years. Brown led a bipartisan effort to update the program’s rules against accumulating savings in a bank account last year, but party leaders kept the change out of an end-of-year government funding bill .

176,'A legend' – Tributes pour in for Sen. Dianne Feinstein after she announces retirement,I,2023-02-14 20:37:00,"WASHINGTON – From the U.S. Capitol to the Bay Area, tributes poured in Tuesday to honor Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who announced that she would not seek re-election in 2024 . ""Our wonderful colleague from California Senator Feinstein has announced that she is not seeking another term,"" Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer said at a news conference Tuesday. ""She'll be fighting the fight with us for the next year and a half. But she's a legend. A legend in California, as the first woman senator. A legend in this Senate. She was the leader on so many different issues: assault weapons, environment, women's rights and so much else,"" the senator from New York went on to say. Former House Speaker Rep. Nancy Pelosi said, ""For the past thirty years, California and our Country has been magnificently served by the leadership of Senator Feinstein: from our national security and personal safety, to the health of our people and our planet, to the strength of our Democracy."" Pelosi, who represents San Francisco in Congress, also noted Feinstein's long-standing ties to the city and her rise to the mayor's office following the 1978 assassinations of Mayor George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk. ""She broke barriers as the first woman to serve as Mayor of San Francisco — and in a moment of horror and heartbreak, she offered our City poised, courageous and hopeful leadership,"" Pelosi said. ""Senator Feinstein has been a powerful champion for California and California values on the national stage for three decades - changing lives across our state and the nation for the better while opening doors for generations for women leaders,"" said California Governor Gavin Newsom in a statement. ""Her lifetime of service and leadership has made out country fairer, safer and stronger, and I am proud to call her a mentor and a friend. California and the nation owe Senator Feinstein a deep debt of gratitude."" San Francisco Mayor London Breed, the only other woman elected to the office, said, ""Sen. Feinstein will leave a long legacy of legislative achievements and shattered glass ceilings that young women everywhere can look to and be inspired by as they too consider what service they can do for their country."" Sen. Alex Padilla, who currently serves alongside Feinstein said, ""You can't tell the story of California politics-or the story of American politics-without the trailblazing career of Dianne Feinstein. For five decades, California has been privileged to have as gifted, as dedicated, and as iconic a public servant as my colleague."" ""On a personal note, Dianne gave me one of my first jobs in politics as a young MIT grad looking to make a difference in my community. She was the embodiment of principled leadership and taking on the difficult issues, and it's in part because of her groundbreaking career that a Latino son of immigrants could one day join her in breaking down barriers and serving alongside her,"" he went on to say. Rep. Adam Schiff, one of the Democrats seeking Feinstein's Senate seat next year, has also issued a statement. ""As the longest-serving woman senator, Senator Feinstein is trailblazer, and her accomplishments are immense and far from over. From the torture report and her dogged pursuit of gun safety to her championship of LGBTQ+ rights and conservation of California's greatest resources, Senator Feinstein's expansive body of work and defense of our democracy will define her legacy,"" Schiff said. ""All of California is indebted to Dianne for her decades of distinguished service."" ""Senator Feinstein has been a barrier breaker for all of us who have been inspired by her monumental career, myself included,"" said Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Oakland). Lee, who has been rumored as a potential candidate for the 2024 race, said she would address questions about the contest soon. ""Senator Feinstein is the most accomplished Senator in California's history. She focused every day of her career on helping her constituents, and she always succeeded in finding a way to get it done,"" said Rep. John Garamendi. ""Every Californian, and indeed everyone in our country, benefited from her tireless work and determination to solve problems. It has been a privilege to work with such a dedicated leader. She has been tireless in giving her life to our great state, and I look forward to continuing to work closely with her throughout the rest of her term."" Other lawmakers from the Bay Area posted their appreciation for Feinstein on social media, pointing to her decades of public service. In her statement , Feinstein said she would do as much as she can for the state in her remaining year-and-a-half in office. ""Even with a divided Congress, we can still pass bills that will improve lives. Each of us was sent here to solve problems. That's what I've done for the last 30 years, and that's what I plan to do for the next two years. My thanks to the people of California for allowing me to serve them,"" she said. At 89, Feinstein is the longest-serving woman ever to serve in the U.S. Senate, with her career in politics dating back to 1969 when she served on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. She was first elected to the Senate in 1992.",politics,176

Advertisement Levin didn’t like the name-calling (though he made sure to point out he does like meatballs), saying the taunt “ will turn off a lot of conservative voters.” He added: “Not a wise move if true.

182,California looks to enshrine right to same-sex marriage in state constitution,I,2023-02-14 18:37:00,"SACRAMENTO — California, a U.S. trendsetter for progressive policies and a state where the current governor once made news issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples in San Francisco before it was legal, will attempt to enshrine marriage equality in the state constitution. The effort comes 15 years after a voter-approved initiative, called Proposition 8, banned the state from recognizing same-sex marriages. In 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court cleared the way for same-sex marriage in California. The constitutional amendment is still on the books, however, and that worries advocates who think the high court may revisit the 2015 case that legalized gay marriage nationwide. ""It's absolute poison, it is so destructive and it's humiliating that this is in our constitution,"" said Democrat Scott Wiener, a state senator who represents San Francisco. He and Democratic Assembly Member Evan Low of Silicon Valley plan to introduce legislation Tuesday to rescind Proposition 8. The measure would need to be approved in the Legislature by a two-thirds vote, and then it will ultimately fall to voters to decide via a referendum. In the days leading up to Proposition 8′s approval, Low joined opponents of the measure outside his alma mater De Anza College in Cupertino, California, to call on voters to reject the initiative. When it passed, it felt personal to Low, who is gay. ""Why do fellow Californians hate me?"" he said. ""Why do they feel that my rights should be eliminated?"" California could follow in the footsteps of Nevada, which in 2020 became the first state to amend its constitution to ensure the right to same-sex marriage. The matter took on fresh urgency last year when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the right to an abortion established by Roe v. Wade. At the time, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas called into question other prominent cases and urged the court to reconsider them. His list included Obergefell v. Hodges, which forced states to issue and recognize same-sex marriages. ""In future cases, we should reconsider all of this Court's substantive due process precedents, including Griswold, Lawrence, and Obergefell,"" Thomas wrote, referencing two other landmark cases involving access to birth control and a decision striking down laws against same-sex sexual activity. In December, President Joe Biden signed into law the Respect for Marriage Act , which requires states to recognize same-sex marriages, but the legislation doesn't force states to allow them if Obergefell is overturned. Wiener and Low, the two California lawmakers, hope to replicate the process under which state voters in November approved a constitutional change guaranteeing the right to abortion . Proposition 8 has yet to be repealed because there was less urgency to do so after the state was allowed to resume issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples and gay marriage was legalized nationwide, Wiener said. ""It became a fire drill once the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade,"" he said. The path to marriage equality in the Golden State was uneven. In 2000, voters approved a statute that banned the recognition of same-sex marriages, a measure that was overturned by the courts. Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat who became San Francisco's mayor in 2004, issued marriages in the city to same-sex couples in a move that defied the law and ran counter to views then held by many in his party. In 2005, the California Legislature was ahead of all other states when it passed a bill to legalize same-sex marriage. But then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican, vetoed it. Support for marriage equality has rapidly expanded since the Obergefell ruling. While Mormon groups helped fund the Proposition 8 campaign in California, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints came out in support of the Respect for Marriage Act. Tony Hoang, executive director of Equality California, is optimistic the group can help build a large supportive coalition for the proposed amendment. ""I know this will be a bipartisan campaign,"" he said.",politics,182

184,Mike Pence To Push Back On Special Counsel Subpoena: Reports,I,2023-02-14 17:41:55,"Former Vice President Mike Pence is reportedly planning to fight a grand jury subpoena from the Justice Department that would require him to testify about former President Donald Trump ’s role in the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol. Sources familiar with Pence’s plans offered details Tuesday to Politico , NBC News and The New York Times , saying Pence plans to argue that the vice president’s duties as president of the Senate protect him from such legal scrutiny, and that he intends to cite the U.S. Constitution’s “speech or debate clause.” Advertisement That provision is intended to safeguard congressional officials from legal proceedings associated with their work, but legal scholars say it’s unclear whether those protections extend to the vice president, who’s tasked with breaking ties in the chamber but is not considered a senator. “It is admittedly a constitutionally murky area with no clear outcome,” Mark Rozell, a George Mason University political scientist who specializes in executive privilege, told Politico on Tuesday. News first broke last week that Special Counsel Jack Smith, who the Justice Department appointed to oversee its investigations into Trump, had subpoenaed Pence. In addition to leading the probe into Trump’s actions around the Jan. 6 riot, Smith is supervising a probe exploring the alleged mishandling of classified government records found at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida last year.

Taxpayers all over the US received the good news on Friday that the central taxation status has made a special consideration in relation to the stimulus check given by 21 states throughout 2022. Payments made as stimulus check, relief payment, or tax refund under various schemes to support the residents during a time of inflation is not taxable income. These US states made these payments to help people combat the rising prices of basic goods including food, medicines, and gas. IRS Taxable Stimulus Check IRS made a complex yet unique tax situation regarding the stimulus check since they requested taxpayers to hold off their tax filing process for 2022. The agency is yet to decide whether it will make the stimulus payment a taxable income or not. They have reviewed the situation and informed us that they would not challenge the standard taxable deduction status for the special state stimulus payments. Several US states offered stimulus payments including Rhode Island, Oregon, Pennsylvania, New Mexico, Main, New York, New Jersey, Illinois, Idaho, Maine, Florida, Delaware, Hawaii, Colorado, Connecticut, California, and Delaware. Residents of these 16 states who received relief payments do not need to report it because it is not taxable. Relief Payments Are Not Taxable IRS has made special consideration for Alaska to make their stimulus check non-taxable since they are experiencing the worst inflation. However, residents of Virginia, Georgia, South Carolina, and Massachusetts will be taxed normally on their stimulus check amount. IRS has stated that the previous declaration of a pandemic emergency will conclude in May 2023. As a result, the agency will allow special taxation consideration for the tax filing of 2022.

186,Resilience must drive USAID’s programs—Illustrations from Afghanistan,George Ingram,2023-02-14 16:15:49,"By George Ingram, Naheed Sarabi The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has under review a draft revision of its 2012 resilience policy for fragile and conflict environments. As reported in the OECD’s “States of Fragility 2022,” fragility has been rising in recent years and is present across a diversity of country contexts. Of the 60 countries identified as fragile, 23 are low-income, and 33 are middle-income. Approximately half of the more than 100 countries in which USAID operates are on the list, highlighting that resilience should be at the core of the agency’s operating procedures. Principles of resilience The draft policy sets out seven principles for resilience: Use evidence and analysis Employ cross-sectoral approaches Operationalize humanitarian-development-peace Strengthen systems for resilience Practice adaptive management Enable local agency and ownership Ensure equity and inclusion   These seven principles represent not just good practice for building resilience, but good practice for development. It is noteworthy that one of those principles puts USAID in sync with the OECD’s 2022 report on fragility, the theme of which is bringing coherence to the humanitarian-development-peace complex. There are a handful of topics that deserve further elaboration in the draft, but one rises to the level of being an eighth principle—donor coordination and collaboration. Donor Coordination: The draft includes references to coordination, but principally to coordination among U.S. government agencies and with local partners. This coordination is important, but equally critical is coherence among donor policies and programs. The United States cannot advance development globally or in a country acting alone. The alternative—coordination among donors—needs to be at the center of donor efforts. Without question, donor coordination is easier to commit to than to execute, as each donor has its own priorities and complexity of operating procedures and requirements. But there are mechanisms for overcoming those difficulties: construct donor programs around a recipient country’s development strategy (as happens with education through the Global Partnership); collaborate around a country-led platform, as recommended in the seminal USIP report “Preventing Extremism in Fragile States“; put funding in another donor program that is working well (as UK Aid is doing with the USAID-funded TAPAS e-procurement program in Ukraine). As the largest contributor of ODA, the U.S. can lead by example in donor coordination on account of the impact it can have by the way it operates. For example, over a 20-year period in Afghanistan, the U.S. contributed to multi-donor trust funds like the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF). The ARTF, administered by the World Bank, implemented the largest national programs on health, education, and community development. ARTF’s role was crucial in providing budget support to the government and instrumental in building systems, one of the principles of resilience policy. The U.S. participation in the fund helped keep donor priorities in line with those of the ARTF. Such platforms are especially critical in fragile environments and during periods of political and economic shocks where domestic structures fail to coordinate donor efforts. However, lessons learned from past experiences and the implementation of frameworks such as the “New Deal for Engagement in Fragile States” advocated by g7+ countries highlight the challenges of donor coordination. For Afghanistan (a member of g7+), aligning international development cooperation with government priorities, ownership, and achieving effective aid delivery was an ongoing concern. Despite international commitments to align ODA with government programs, according to a donor cooperation report by the Afghan government, the actual practice fell short, resulting in a financial gap in delivering government priorities. There was a lack of consensus as to what alignment with government priorities meant, leaving discretion to individual donors and sometimes the priorities of their constituencies. These challenges underscore the need for continued efforts to improve coordination and alignment between donors and recipient countries in order to achieve the goals of development cooperation and to move from statements to actual measurable practices. Topics deserving further elaboration Trust: The draft should provide greater attention to the triad of trust, politics, and social dynamics in a country. The lack of trust by the citizens of a country in the government and institutions is more often than not at the core of fragility. Fragility reflects a breakdown in the social contract between a people and the government, which, to be rebuilt, requires government leaders and agencies to listen and respond to the grievances and hopes of citizens. Too often donors design programs that are technically proficient but irrelevant or even counterproductive because they ignore the political and social contexts in a country. Without a doubt, this was likely a core problem with much of the billions of assistance that donors poured into attempting to bring stability to Afghanistan. The Ministry of Finance data in 2018 showed that only 33 percent of total grants to Afghanistan were on-budget. This created a relationship gap between national and local authorities, and between government and citizens, in the delivery of services and so failed to strengthen trust by means of the social contract between people and government. Risk: Donors must take greater risks and be more innovative. In fragile environments, donors are operating in an “unknown environment complicated by unexpected changes”—due to the difficulty in comprehending the underlying political and social foundations of a country and the frequently altering dynamics. Change is difficult and complicated in fragile environments and requires donors to take steps beyond the “true and tested” approaches or just work with new partners. The draft policy appropriately raises adaptability to the level of a key principle, as donor programs must tack with changing circumstances and move with agility away from efforts failing to produce results. Sustained engagement: Building resilience and stability requires going beyond the typical donor timeframe of two-to-five years. It is a 20-25-50-year process requiring sustained, focused engagement. Progress is never linear and requires sustained donor support over the long haul. The predictability of external support is crucial for long-term development planning. Case in point: unpredictable resources limited Afghanistan’s ability to create multi-year programs and budgets. Donors would make four-year funding commitments, but yearly obligations often failed to fulfill those commitments and ignored Afghanistan’s budget cycle. Managing partnerships: The draft policy does not address a key challenge in fragile environments—how to engage and how to manage relations with partners who may be unstable, have questionable commitment to reform, and in whom the donor does not have full confidence. Private sector: Consistent with the World Bank’s “Strategy for Fragility, Conflict, and Violence 2020-2025,” which posits that “the private sector lies at the center of sustainable development model in fragile-conflict-violence settings,” the draft policy asserts that local and international business can play an important role in the transition to economic growth and stability. But the draft policy does not explain USAID’s specific role, and how it can help lay the groundwork for private sector investment. This requires work at the macroeconomic level and in building supportive systems, and at the transaction level. This is an arena in which collaboration is essential. USAID needs to join its resource and capabilities with those of other agencies, specifically the DFC, that are engaged in mobilizing development finance. Small-to-scale: As articulated in the 2018 “Stabilization Assistance Review,” projects should start small, essentially in a test phase, and be scaled up only upon proof-of-concept. This approach applies in any development context (not just in fragile environments), requires ongoing feedback and adaptive management, and is best understood in the roadmap provided by Ann Mei Chang in “Lean Impact.” Flexibility and innovation: Service delivery and locally-led development require innovative approaches in conflict environments. The Community Development Councils (CDCs) in Afghanistan are a successful example of how service delivery through locally-led platforms can build trust between people and government for 18 years. Studies show that CDCs have been more efficient in delivering emergency response, operating in areas under the Taliban control during the republic; as well as provision of basic infrastructure at a lower cost and up to international benchmarks. The CDCs were capacitated and coordinated by the government to ensure ownership and efficiency. While monitoring of education and health services has been successful, delivery of agriculture programs proved challenging. From projects to programs: The U.S. and the Afghan government launched a unique effort to review the U.S. civilian assistance in Afghanistan. It was a major step in information sharing with the host country about the nature of off-budget assistance. A major finding from the government side was that a shift from projects (the U.S. was administering 155 projects) to programs was needed to achieve development goals and improve efficiency and coordination. Conclusion The need for greater resilience is present in all countries—those that are extremely poor, emerging countries, and even wealthy nations. But the need varies depending on contexts that are specific to each country. The policies laid out in the draft resilience update represent best practices and need only minor additions and elaboration. Whatever the details of the final policy, resilience should drive USAID’s programs in all countries and serve to inform the policies and programs of other U.S. government agencies and other donors.",politics,186

Bolton’s representative confirmed to The Hill that Bolton will issue a statement after the briefing, set for Wednesday. He will be briefed by the office of the director of national intelligence, according to CNN ’s Kaitlan Collins. Advertisement John Bolton, who served as Trump's national security adviser, will be briefed by the Biden administration on Wednesday, I'm told. The briefing is expected to be conducted by the office of the director of national intelligence. — Kaitlan Collins (@kaitlancollins) February 13, 2023 President Joe Biden’s administration said in the uproar that followed the announcement this month that a Chinese spy balloon was floating over the country that at least three other Chinese surveillance balloons flew over the U.S. when Trump was president. Another one floated over the U.S. earlier in Biden’s administration, the Pentagon said. Bolton and other former Trump officials claimed they had no knowledge of the earlier incidents. Biden’s team offered to brief Trump officials about the balloons and Bolton accepted. Bolton has said he has “a long list of questions.” “We have barely scratched the surface on the Chinese balloons,” Bolton wrote in a op-ed for the New York Post Sunday . Advertisement The U.S., which shot down the spy balloon off the coast of South Carolina on Feb. 4, also has shot down three lower-altitude flying objects in the past week over Alaska, Canada and Lake Huron. John Kirby, the National Security Council’s coordinator for strategic communications, said the White House has discovered a wider surveillance program by China’s military using high-altitude balloons. “It was operating during the previous administration, but they did not detect it,” Kirby told reporters at Monday’s White House briefing. “We detected it. We tracked it. And we have been carefully studying it to learn as much as we can.” Kirby also sought to explain why the U.S. acted quickly to shoot down the still-unidentified smaller objects, but waited longer to take down the balloon. We assessed “that their altitudes were considerably lower than the Chinese high-altitude balloon and did pose a threat to civilian commercial air traffic,” Kirby said. “And while we have no specific reason to suspect that they were conducting surveillance of any kind, we couldn’t rule that out.” Advertisement Related Donald Trump Joe Biden China John Bolton spy balloon Chinese Spy Balloon Was Element Of Vast Surveillance Program: Reports White House Fact-Checks Fox News With GOP Senator's Own Words Joe Biden Messes With China In Spoof SOTU Entry On ‘The Tonight Show’ Related Donald Trump Joe Biden China John Bolton spy balloon The Best Part Of Joe Biden's SOTU Address Happened After It Was Over GOP Sen.

Senators are expected to debate and then vote on whether to include additional witnesses and documents today in the Senate impeachment trial of President Trump. (Photo by Sarah Silbiger/Getty Images) Former president Donald Trump has been trying to prove himself innocent since the beginning of the charges he started facing. His one of the evil deeds which caused misfortune, and he got caught. From fraud voting to a goons attack at Capitol hill, to rape charges, he is all over the place. A bunch of intellectual heads are working on this case, to prove his guilt. Whereas, his attorneys are playing the safe card where he could be proven innocent. Even his lawyers were ordered by the department of justice to bring forth all the documents they find in the search.

Although his administration during the time of his presidency hid the evidence pretty well. And in certain cases, they burned it. And according to his lawyer’s statement, whatever they found in the house of former president Trump’s residence, they handed them over to the DOJ. DOJ rescued a file named classified evening summary, which according to Timothy Parlatore’s client Trump, used as nightguard of a lamp. Which was disturbing his sleep, and he could not find anything, so he used that file to maintain his goodnight’s sleep. And Trump’s lawyers didn’t waste a minute handing it over to the DOJ, and it showed how sincere they are. And how harmless Donald Trump is. Whenever the judge asked why those crucial papers doing at Trump’s residence even after two years of completing his presidency.

It has been saving lives since the pandemic, the whole world was ruptured. Cities became death valley, the number of dead bodies increased and employment decreased. And just after the pandemic, America fall into the hands of the deadliest inflation, which skyrocketed in 2022. The middle-class family was struggling to meet ends, and the cry for stimulus checks arose. But it was clearly stated by the federal government there will be no further checks. If they issue another check it would lead to another economic disruption in the country, which could not be resurrected. Some states have already sent out checks whereas, Michigan is yet to make the decision. Michigan’s Governor Heard Cries For Stimulus Check Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer has proposed an idea to the yearly budgeting to send out stimulus checks, with at least $180.This could boost the confidence of the citizens. And a little bit of financial assistance which everyone looks forward to. The tax filing portal to apply for stimulus checks would be open till 18th April and start on 23rd January. Taxpayers who have paid the taxes of last year are eligible to apply. The couple who are willing to file jointly, won’t be receiving more than $180.The stimulus check range is set for everyone, be it individual or joint filers. However, there are gaps that need to be filled with bridges , and the bridges of information are yet not been fully discussed by government officials. But they would be doing that too soon. A taxpayer asked when they will be getting their payments, and the officials responded to that query, this spring they would start rolling out the checks.

Gretchen Whitmer got four more years to serve their residents. In spite of the presidential run ahead of her, she is focused on her governing duty. She enjoys being the governor of Michigan. After last year’s election, she has proposed an inflation relief check for their residents, which is a work in progress. But she is positive she could bring it to pass. Gretchen Whitmer’s Historical Fight In her own words, she loves what she is doing right now. And didn’t think of any other thing but the next four years of governorship. Even though president Joe Biden will be running for reelection in 2024, Gretchen Whitmer is not worried about the 2028 election whatsoever. She has successfully blocked the enforcement of Michigan’s 1931 abortion ban. She has uplifted it and created history. The election was about making the women of Michigan feel comfortable, and who are able to make choices. And Gretchen Whitmer’s last win cemented her place of her in Biden’s top picks of representatives for the house of congress. Gretchen Whitmer is not thinking about long-term goals, and always kind of brushed off the topic of campaigning for the 2028 election. Her primary job is to provide for the democratic party. She recalled the 2022 campaign of an election where she focused on abortion rights, which confidentially brought success to them. Abortion right was one of the biggest challenges in history. Making it true and helping all those helpless women was at top of her list.

200,New bill would expedite approval process for all mix-income housing projects,I,2023-02-14 00:34:00,"SAN FRANCISCO – After California cities were recently mandated to expand their housing targets, State Sen. Scott Wiener wants to streamline the approval process for all mixed-income housing projects in a new bill introduced on Monday. If passed, Senate Bill 423 would build on 2017's Senate Bill 35, which required cities failing to meet their affordable housing goals to expedite the approval timeline so certain construction projects can begin to break ground. Also authored by Wiener (D-San Francisco), the law enforces a three to six month-deadline for local jurisdictions to review and approve subsidized affordable residential housing projects, so long as they are in an urban area, do not demolish historic buildings or other units, meet objective planning standards and pay prevailing wages, among other criteria. SB 423 would expand the provisions to include all mixed-income housing units, and ensure that SB 35's initial sunset date in 2026 would be extended. Wiener said that in the law's first four years, it has helped build or approve 18,000 units, with three-quarters of those units being below-market rate. He said SB 35 has been ""absolutely transformational"" in getting housing in a time where the state is ""short millions of homes."" He said that expanding the litigation to include more housing projects will further remove barriers as cities like San Francisco are vying to reach ambitious housing quotas. Just last month, the city passed a new Housing Element, which calls for the construction of over 82,000 homes in the next eight years - which is over three times the number of homes the city produced on average in the past decade. ""It's very simple -- If you meet all the rules, you meet the zoning, the setbacks, the designs and everything else, you can get your permit without a hyper-politicized, chaotic process that could take years and lead to litigation because anyone who has an attorney can challenge you,"" Wiener said. Ramie Dare of Mercy Housing said SB 35 has allowed the affordable housing developer to create a pipeline to quickly provide housing for seniors, people exiting homelessness, young mothers and people with disabilities. ""When you think about how long so many people wait for a safe, affordable place to call home every single day makes a difference,"" said Dare. One example is 833 Bryant Street, a permanent supportive housing project that once was a parking lot. Dare said Mercy Housing utilized SB 35 to turn the lot into homes in less than three years, which is 30 percent faster than comparable supportive housing developments. Elaine Luna is one the 145 residents that currently lives at the complex, located in the SOMA district. Before Luna moved in, they called a shelter their main residence, and before then, a tent. When they were homeless, Luna said they felt like there was no place for them to safely store their possessions, have peace and privacy, or even use the bathroom. They considered their move into 833 Bryant a ""godsend,"" as they never imagined the chance to move into an apartment like this on their own. ""Nobody chooses to be homeless. Nobody chooses to be in the streets,"" Luna said. ""There just isn't affordable housing like this, because not everyone has great paying jobs. If you work at the supermarket making minimum wage, it doesn't cover rent, or it does and you have no money for anything else."" California YIMBY, a housing advocacy group that is co-sponsoring the legislation, said the law has made it cheaper and faster for low-income housing developers to carry out their work, while also backing projects with well-paying jobs for construction workers. ""California, as the senator noted, needs millions of new homes, for people of all incomes and at all stages of life,"" said California YIMBY's CEO, Brian Hanlon. ""It only makes sense to do more of what works to make sure those homes are built and that they're built by workers who received a fair wage."" The Nor Cal Carpenters Union, another co-sponsor, said this bill could help protect thousands of construction workers from wage theft, tax fraud and health care insecurities by requiring contractors to provide fair wages, apprenticeship opportunities and benefits. ""This bill is another example on how prevailing wages will become the new standard for how housing legislation gets passed, protecting workers and protecting the workforce that is building a better California,"" said Ron Rowlett, director of government affairs for the union.",politics,200

205,Is The IRS Making The People Pay The Taxes On Stimulus Check Payments?,Md Shahnawaz,2023-02-11 05:45:22,"Economy Stimulus Check Top Stories Is The IRS Making The People Pay The Taxes On Stimulus Check Payments? By Md Shahnawaz - February 11, 2023 stimulus check The IRS has recommended that some taxpayers should be holding off on filing their tax returns for 2022, as it will be taking a closer look at the stimulus check programs in some of the states like Georgia, and South Carolina. In the state of South Carolina, the state legislators have already approved a tax refund of around $800 when they had previously approved the budget of the state the previous summer. The rebate check did go out to quite a few people the previous year. The IRS has also recommended that these people should be waiting to file their taxes, but for those who have already filed for the payments, the IRS has already filed for an amended return. The IRS Could Tax The Stimulus check payments Brandon Smith, a young partner at Smith and Shin CPA, went on to state that if one hasn’t already filed for their tax returns and seems to be concerned, one could wait until the next week. But if they have already filed for their stimulus check payment, there is no reason to amend it- rather, they could wait for any further information from the IRS. The good news that is on the horizon is the rebate checks issued by the state of South Carolina will not be taxed by the state- so the state filing could be in the clear. And when it comes to federal taxes, the percentage should be minuscule when compared to the overall tax liability. Even if the stimulus check payments were taxable, for federal purposes or the IRS, it will have a very small impact overall- simply because the payment maxes out at around $800. Therefore, the tax could be as low as 0, or even 40%- entirely dependent on how much money an individual would make. Interestingly, people from close to 22 states have been working on this issue for the last few weeks, and as far as the IRS is concerned they just might not tax the state rebate payments.

Residents were worried about even the payments are taxable or not. Clearly, it isn’t. Residents were crying for help, and the states came up with plans and they executed them. Thus, they come with several consequences, which the state government probably failed to mention before issuing the checks. And residents might now pay the price. Comfortable Stimulus Check Are Now Proving To Be A Nightmare The stimulus check, which once provided residents with peace and comfort are now became a nightmare. The agencies are seeking clarification from the upper level even the payments are taxable or not. And the IRS clearly advised claimers to consult with reputable tax agencies who could provide some clarity on the situation. Many were hoping to if those stimulus checks can be considered as income, but well IRS has declared they are not. The situation is getting out of hand and pressure among citizens is rising day by day. All social media platforms are flooding with questions and already billions of retweets. One California taxpayer tweeted that funny thing, IRS hasn’t declared if the middle-class tax refunds are taxable or not. Mockery is taking over the situation. Now stimulus check has taken away residents’ goodnight sleep. They didn’t even declare which states payments are taxable yet, among the 18 states who have issued the one-time payments. As these payments weren’t from the federal government, they did come with a bunch of pros and cons, and now state governments are at fault. They didn’t make the claimers aware of the upcoming consequences they might face if they file for tax returns. Last year inflation hiked, and residents filed for their taxes hoping for a stimulus check in a hurry.

207,White House Says It’s “Inaccurate” That Biden Will Sit Down for Pre-Super Bowl Interview With Fox,Alex Weprin,2023-02-10 17:27:15,"It seems President Biden will not sit for a Super Bowl Sunday interview with anyone from Fox Corp., after all. “As we said earlier, we had arranged an interview with FOX Sports Host Mike Hill & Vivica A. Fox with the President ahead of the Super Bowl and Fox Corp. had the interview canceled,” a new statement from the White House said. “Fox has since put out a statement indicating the interview was rescheduled, which is inaccurate.” The most recent statement comes after a day of confusing back and forth where press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Fox canceled President Biden’s interview, which was set to be on Fox Soul, and Fox claimed it didn’t. “After the White House reached out to Fox Soul Thursday evening, there was some initial confusion,” the company said in a statement. “Fox Soul looks forward to interviewing the President for Super Bowl Sunday.” Earlier in the day, breaking from tradition, the White House signaled Biden will not sit down for an interview with Fox News during the network’s pre-Super Bowl pregame show. “The President was looking forward to an interview with Fox Soul to discuss the Super Bowl, the State of the Union, and critical issues impacting the everyday lives of Black Americans,” Jean-Pierre said in a statement. “We’ve been informed that Fox Corp has asked for the interview to be cancelled.” Fox Soul is a free streaming service and digital broadcast network targeting African American audiences that is owned by Fox Corp. A White House official said that they had “locked” an interview with sportscaster Mike Hill and TV personality Vivica A. Fox for Fox Soul, which could have been shared across Fox platforms (including, presumably, on the Fox Super Bowl pregame show.) The Super Bowl interview — always with the network that airs the Big Game — really began with President Bush in 2004, though it was Obama who turned it into an annual event. Obama was interviewed every year of his presidency, including on Fox News, where he occasionally sparred with Bill O’Reilly. President Trump was interviewed by Fox News while in office, and with CBS News, though he declined to participate in 2018 when NBC had the Super Bowl rights. Biden has given a few interviews this week (with the PBS Newshour and Telemundo), but by not participating in the Super Bowl interview, he will be missing out on a large (and bipartisan) audience. Biden has only given a handful of one-on-one interviews since taking office, and none have been with Fox. The White House said that it booked the interview with Fox Soul because “reaching diverse audiences in innovative ways is a cornerstone of the President’s media strategy,” and, with the big game airing on the Fox broadcast network, it may have been hoping that Fox would take the Fox Soul interview for the pregame show too. Of course, Fox News is one of the most powerful pieces of the company’s portfolio, and it appears Fox Corp. was not going to let the sidestepping of Fox News happen.

Bedingfield, who has led Biden’s communications apparatus for four years, will depart at the end of the month, and will be succeeded by Ben LaBolt, a veteran of the Obama administration. “Since my time as Vice President, Kate has been a loyal and trusted adviser, through thick and thin,” said Biden in a statement. “She was a critical strategic voice from the very first day of my presidential campaign in 2019 and has been a key part of advancing my agenda in the White House. The country is better off as a result of her hard work and I’m so grateful to her – and to her husband and two young children – for giving so much.” The communications executive is also no stranger to the entertainment business. In addition to being a regular presence on cable news during her time working for Biden, Bedingfield previously served as the chief spokesperson for the Motion Picture Association of America. She also worked for Monumental Sports & Entertainment, which owns the Washington Wizards NBA team. She was also deputy communications director in the Obama administration. “Ben has big shoes to fill. I look forward to welcoming him back as a first-rate communicator who’s shown his commitment to public service again and again, and who has a cutting-edge understanding of how Americans consume information,” Biden added. “I saw him fight for Justice Jackson, and he put his all into helping us make history confirming our cabinet and subcabinet nominees.

209,Biden State Of Union Speech Harps On Economic Growth: No Indication Of Further Stimulus Check,Md Shahnawaz,2023-02-10 13:32:17,"Economy Stimulus Check Top Stories Biden State Of Union Speech Harps On Economic Growth: No Indication Of Further Stimulus Check By Md Shahnawaz - February 10, 2023 Stimulus Check Biden’s second State of the Union address harped strongly on the US economy and its performance post-pandemic, which generally coincided with his two years at the top. The federal support in the war against inflation was bipartisan in the initial year when the first two of the three stimulus checks were introduced under the Trump administration. But things changed with the third stimulus check under the American Rescue Plan Act of March 2021. Immediately after taking over in January 2021 after a controversial election and its aftermath, incoming president Joe Biden made it a priority to honor his election promise of sending out a $2,000 stimulus check to every deserving American. The third stimulus check or the Economic Impact Payment was, in the end, whittled down to $1,400, though it remains the biggest federal direct support ever. President Joe Biden was all praise for the American economy and also his legislative accomplishments in his address on Tuesday night. He also spoke about the progress he had achieved and mentioned the turnaround in foreign policy from the time of his predecessor. While President Biden stayed away from outright falsehoods, there were instances when he failed to be open with the facts. At other times he exaggerated some facts or omitted crucial context. President Biden Said 12 Million New Jobs Created In His Two Years At The Top The economy has indeed added 12.1 M jobs between the month he took over, which is January 2021, and January this year. While this is indeed a larger increase in the number of new jobs added over any other full-term serving presidents since 1945, by percentage terms he lags behind several other presidents. While jobs increased by 8.5% under Biden’s rule, it was higher for Obama at 8.6%, Bill Clinton, 1.5% in his first term, President Reagan, in whose 2 nd term 11.2% was added and 12.8% in Jimmy Carter’s 4 years in office. But then President Biden was comparing his two years with the entire term of other presidents. So the comparison is not equal to be fair to him. But then President Biden’s initial two years were preceded by a huge loss as the economy was brought almost to a standstill during the pandemic period in 2020. President Biden also referred to the drastic rise in prices and said that inflation had been a global issue as a result of the disruption in production and supply chain wrought about by the pandemic. he also blamed the war in Europe for the disruption in the oil supply and also the distribution of food items. But President Biden failed to mention that the inflation rate in the US has been way above the world average of developed economies. And it was partly fueled by the third stimulus check that created an abnormally robust demand for goods and led to a scarcity of many items. It was more a combination of factors caused by the stimulus check and the huge money that was pumped into the economy in a short time with the second and third stimulus checks coming in quick succession. Critics of the stimulus checks contend that inflation has been one of the driving factors of inflation. That is one of the reasons that inflation in Europe and other developed countries has not been as severe and nowhere near the 8-9% mark that has become the norm in the US in 2022. State Stimulus Checks Remain The Only Lifeline In 2022 The IRS continues to process the federal stimulus checks for the 10 million Americans who did not receive the third stimulus checks, the expanded Child Tax Credit Stimulus check, and the Earned Income Tax Credit. But the federal administration has not been able to muster the requisite support of Congress to move toward another round of stimulus checks. This has forced states to continue with some form of a stimulus check to support residents as they fight rising prices for over a year. Many residents of states such as California, Idaho, Colorado, New Mexico, Illinois, South Carolina, and Pennsylvania who have filed their income tax returns are eligible for some form of support from their respective states. While states such as Maine and New Mexico have sent out their version of the stimulus check to residents, California has delayed its Middle-Class Tax Rebate to coincide with the festive season. The flexed Middle-Class rebate program in California was made out to residents with an Adjusted Gross Income of less than $250,000 for individuals and double that for a married couple filing jointly in 2020 in California. Eligible residents received between $200 to $1,050 depending on their income for that year and also the inclusion of dependents. The maximum amount will go out to married or joint filers whose accumulated income for California in 2020 was below $150,000. This was revealed by the Franchise Tax Board of California. Over $9 billion in stimulus checks have already gone out to 31,650,087 taxpaying residents of California by January 13, 2023, the FTB website has revealed. The final drive for the California Middle-Class Tax Rebate will be by debit card for any resident filers who have changed their residential address after filing their income tax returns for the state for 2020. The Colorado stimulus checks worth $750 for individuals and doubles that amount for married couples filing jointly will go out to those who are yet to receive their refund by end-January. This was revealed by the Colorado Cash Back program authorities. Governor Brad Little of Idaho signed a $500 M law in September 2022 that gives out $300 or 10% to eligible residents who have filed their 2020 and 2021 income tax returns. The higher of the two amounts will be paid to such residents. Residents of Illinois are in line to receive two stimulus checks if they successfully qualify for the payments. While the first one is linked to their income, the second stimulus check is based on the property tax filed. The return on income is between $50 and $100 and is based on the claimed income of $200,000 as individuals and double that amount for married couples or joint filers.

210,How To Block Spoofed Calls Android?,Mark Funk,2023-02-16 10:12:31,"Spoofed calls, or calls pretending to come from a legitimate source (such as your own phone number or the IRS), are becoming more and more prevalent. For most people, these unwanted calls are simply an annoyance. But for some, they can lead to identity theft, financial fraud, and other malicious activities. Fortunately, there are steps you can take to protect yourself from these deceptive tactics. In this blog post, we’ll cover how to block spoofed calls on Android devices so that you can stay safe from scammers. How to block spoofed calls on Android? If you’ve been getting a lot of unwanted calls from spoofed numbers lately, you may be wondering how to block them on your Android phone. The good news is that there are a few things you can do to help stop these nuisance calls. First, you can install an app like Mr. Number or TrueCaller, which will help to block known spam numbers. You can also add specific numbers to your block list in your phone’s settings. To do this, go to the Phone app, tap the three dots in the top right corner, and select Settings > Block numbers. If you’re still getting spoofed calls after taking these measures, you can report the number to the FCC by filing a complaint at fcc.gov/complaints. What is a spoofed call? A spoofed call is a phone call made with the intention of tricking someone into thinking it is from a legitimate, trusted source when it is not. Spoofed calls are often used in scams and fraud, such as when a caller pretends to be from a well-known company or government agency in order to get personal information or money from the person they are speaking to. Scammers may also use spoofed calls to spread malware or ransomware. There are several ways to tell if a call might be spoofed. First, pay attention to the number that appears on your caller ID. If you do not recognize the number, or it appears to be from a different country than where you live, that is a red flag. Second, listen for strange background noise on the call, which may be an indication that the caller is using VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) instead of a regular phone line. Finally, beware of anyone who asks for personal information or money upfront; no legitimate company or government agency would do this. If you think you have received a spoofed call, hang up immediately and do not give out any personal information. You can also report the call to your local law enforcement agency and/or the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Why do people spoof calls? There are a few reasons why people may want to spoof their calls. For one, it can allow them to make calls anonymously, which can be useful for making prank calls or for other malicious purposes. It can also be used to hide their real phone number from someone they are calling, which can be helpful if they are trying to avoid someone or if they are being harassed. Additionally, it can be used to make it appear as though they are calling from a different location, which can be useful for bypassing restrictions or for tricking someone into thinking they are somewhere they are not. How to recognize a spoofed call? How to recognize a spoofed call? If you receive a call from an unfamiliar number, or a number that looks similar to your own, it may be a spoofed call. Caller ID spoofing is when someone falsifies the information transmitted to your caller ID in order to disguise their identity. They may use a fake name or number, or even the name and number of someone you know. There are a few things you can do to try and verify the identity of the caller: Ask them to state their name and why they are calling. If they refuse or seem evasive, this is a red flag. If possible, use a reverse phone lookup service to find out who the caller claims to be. If the caller ID shows a local area code but the person on the other end has a foreign accent, this is another red flag. Be suspicious of any unsolicited calls, even if they appear to be from a legitimate source like your bank or doctor’s office. If you’re not expecting a call, don’t give out any personal information. Hang up if the caller asks for sensitive information like your Social Security number, credit card number, or account passwords. No legitimate organization will ever ask for this type of information over the phone. How can you tell if a call is spoofed? When a caller spoofs their phone number, it replaces their real number with a false one on the recipient’s caller ID. There are a few things to look for that can help you determine if a call is spoofed: The caller ID may show a different city or state than where the person is actually calling from.

How to know if you’re getting a spoofed call? If you’re not familiar with the term, “spoofing” is when a caller deliberately falsifies the information transmitted to your caller ID display to disguise their identity. They may pretend to be a local business or service provider that you typically work with, or even a family member or friend. The goal is usually to trick you into answering the call so they can attempt to scam you in some way. Spoofed calls, or calls pretending to come from a legitimate source (such as your own phone number or the IRS), are becoming more and more prevalent. For most people, these unwanted calls are simply an annoyance. But for some, they can lead to identity theft, financial fraud, and other malicious activities. Fortunately, there are steps you can take to protect yourself from these deceptive tactics. In this blog post, we’ll cover how to block spoofed calls on Android devices so that you can stay safe from scammers. How to block spoofed calls on Android? If you’ve been getting a lot of unwanted calls from spoofed numbers lately, you may be wondering how to block them on your Android phone. The good news is that there are a few things you can do to help stop these nuisance calls. First, you can install an app like Mr. Number or TrueCaller, which will help to block known spam numbers. You can also add specific numbers to your block list in your phone’s settings. To do this, go to the Phone app, tap the three dots in the top right corner, and select Settings > Block numbers. If you’re still getting spoofed calls after taking these measures, you can report the number to the FCC by filing a complaint at fcc.gov/complaints. What is a spoofed call? A spoofed call is a phone call made with the intention of tricking someone into thinking it is from a legitimate, trusted source when it is not. Spoofed calls are often used in scams and fraud, such as when a caller pretends to be from a well-known company or government agency in order to get personal information or money from the person they are speaking to. Scammers may also use spoofed calls to spread malware or ransomware. There are several ways to tell if a call might be spoofed. First, pay attention to the number that appears on your caller ID. If you do not recognize the number, or it appears to be from a different country than where you live, that is a red flag. Second, listen for strange background noise on the call, which may be an indication that the caller is using VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) instead of a regular phone line. Finally, beware of anyone who asks for personal information or money upfront; no legitimate company or government agency would do this. If you think you have received a spoofed call, hang up immediately and do not give out any personal information. You can also report the call to your local law enforcement agency and/or the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Why do people spoof calls? There are a few reasons why people may want to spoof their calls. For one, it can allow them to make calls anonymously, which can be useful for making prank calls or for other malicious purposes. It can also be used to hide their real phone number from someone they are calling, which can be helpful if they are trying to avoid someone or if they are being harassed. Additionally, it can be used to make it appear as though they are calling from a different location, which can be useful for bypassing restrictions or for tricking someone into thinking they are somewhere they are not. How to recognize a spoofed call? How to recognize a spoofed call? If you receive a call from an unfamiliar number, or a number that looks similar to your own, it may be a spoofed call. Caller ID spoofing is when someone falsifies the information transmitted to your caller ID in order to disguise their identity. They may use a fake name or number, or even the name and number of someone you know. There are a few things you can do to try and verify the identity of the caller: Ask them to state their name and why they are calling. If they refuse or seem evasive, this is a red flag. If possible, use a reverse phone lookup service to find out who the caller claims to be. If the caller ID shows a local area code but the person on the other end has a foreign accent, this is another red flag. Be suspicious of any unsolicited calls, even if they appear to be from a legitimate source like your bank or doctor’s office. If you’re not expecting a call, don’t give out any personal information. Hang up if the caller asks for sensitive information like your Social Security number, credit card number, or account passwords. No legitimate organization will ever ask for this type of information over the phone. How can you tell if a call is spoofed? When a caller spoofs their phone number, it replaces their real number with a false one on the recipient’s caller ID. There are a few things to look for that can help you determine if a call is spoofed: The caller ID may show a different city or state than where the person is actually calling from. The caller ID may show a number that is similar to your own or to other local businesses. The call may be an unexpected sales pitch or come from someone claiming to be with a government agency. You may hear strange background noises on the call, or the person on the other end may have difficulty hearing you.If you think you may have received a spoofed call, hang up and report it to your local law enforcement agency.

If the number doesn’t match the name of the person or business appearing on your screen, it’s likely that the call is spoofed. Listen for background noise. Spoofers often use automated systems that generate a lot of background noise, so if you hear static, clicks, or other strange noises, it could be a sign that you’re being spoofed. Be suspicious of unexpected calls from unknown numbers. If you receive a call from someone you don’t know and they don’t leave a message, there’s a good chance it’s a spoofed call. If you think you may be receiving spoofed calls, there are steps you can take to protect yourself: Don’t answer calls from unknown numbers.

First, if you pick up the phone and the caller ID says “Unknown” or “Private,” be suspicious. Don’t give out any personal information or financial information. Hang up and call the company back using a phone number you know to be legitimate. If you’ve already given out personal information, call your bank or credit card company and report the fraud. Be sure to change any passwords that may have been compromised. Finally, keep an eye on your credit report for any unusual activity. What to do if you receive a spoofed call?; If you receive a spoofed call, there are several things you can do: Hang up immediately. Do not engage with the caller in any way. If you have caller ID, take note of the number that appears on your screen. This will help you identify the call as a spoofed call. Contact your phone service provider and report the call. They may be able to track down the source of the call and help prevent future spoofed calls from coming through to your phone. Block the number that appeared on your caller ID using your phone’s blocking features. This will help prevent future spoofed calls from coming through to your phone from that number.

With the right settings, you can easily block any unwanted callers and protect yourself from malicious activities. By using caller ID services like Hiya or Trucaller, you can be sure to always know who’s calling you so that you don’t pick up suspicious numbers. Moreover, by enabling certain features such as ‘Do Not Disturb’ mode or ‘Unknown Numbers Blocker’ on your device, you can keep those pesky unverified calls away.

212,BTS now have their very own Lego set — with figures of all seven bandmembers,Monica Chin,2023-02-16 05:00:00,"You, too, can recreate Jimin’s dance break. | Image: Lego Lego teased a collaboration with BTS earlier this month and, needless to say, the fans had questions. Would the set come with photo cards? Will Jimin play with it on a livestream? Does this mean we’ll see BTS in the next Lego Movie? We don’t have all the answers to those questions yet (although I need an answer on the Lego Movie stat). We have, however, finally gotten our first glimpse of this highly anticipated Lego set, which (fairly accurately) replicates the set of the Dynamite music video, complete with mini-figs of the seven group members. The set was based on a fan-submitted idea from two BTS fans and Lego builders. “I watched the music video over and over and tried to capture its essence in the LEGO bricks,” writes 20-year-old Josh Bretz, one of the creators, in Lego’s press release. The 749-piece set includes several of the primary settings featured in the music video, including the donut shop, the record store, the basketball hoop, and that ice cream truck that’s always hanging around. The stage is also present in the back, though that replica isn’t quite as faithful. All the pieces are modular, so you can move them around. Notably missing is Jungkook’s bedroom from the opening verse, though I understand that recreating all those posters with Legos would’ve been a whole thing and a half. Image: Lego I know what you’ve been wondering. Yes, you can make Jungkook hold the donut. Click here for a larger image. Lego has captured some specific details; elements like the graffiti behind the basketball hoop, the addresses printed on the windows of the stores, and the Open sign next to the donut shop are nicely constructed. The green arrow should be angled a bit further down, but I know I’m getting into the weeds here. You also cannot recreate the plane that flies over the second chorus, but you can make Jungkook hold the donut outside the donut shop, which is consolation enough. Image: Lego Suga isn’t wearing this outfit in the real shot, so it’s slightly disconcerting, but we’ll roll with it. Click here for a larger image. The company did a fairly impressive job replicating each member’s hairstyle, considering that we’re talking about...Lego hair. Jungkook’s black hair is easily distinguishable from J-Hope’s black hair, for example. The seven figurines are dressed in the outfits that the group wears beginning at the song’s second chorus (rather than the costumes from their earlier solo shots or the pastel clothing from the beginning and end). Lego doesn’t provide multiple mini-figs for a costume change (and with a US price of $99.99, this is already not the cheapest piece of BTS merch you can buy). The figurines do have multiple expressions, at least; for example, you can make RM wink or just appear somewhat pensive, while Jungkook has both a smile and the bewildered look from his iconic donut shot. Image: Lego Who can resist a wink from V? Click here for a larger image. This Lego set will be on sale in March. While you’re waiting, you can take a look at the pictures Lego has sent over, where the company has made admirable efforts to make the figurines look like they’re doing dance moves with their aerobically-limited limbs.

217,"MediaTek Dimensity 7200 is built on 4nm process, arrives in mid-range Android phones soon",Ben Schoon,2023-02-16 03:46:16,"MediaTek’s bread and butter is on the more affordable end of the spectrum, and the company is today launching its new Dimensity 7200 chipset which is built on a 4nm process and will make its debut in the next month. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); The Dimensity 7200 is a 5G-capable chip that is the debut of MediaTek’s 7000 series. Perhaps the most interesting part of the MediaTek Dimensity 7200 is that it is built on a 4nm process, the same process used for flagship chips such as MediaTek’s Dimensity 9200 , as well as Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon 8 Gen 2. It’s notable as most mid-range chips tend to be built on less-efficient, more outdated build processes. The chip is also produced by TSMC, which only doubles down on the efficiency boosts. Dimensity 7200 has an octa-core design, with two Cortex-A715 cores at 2.8GHz and six Cortex-A510 cores. It also supports Arm’s Mali-C610 MC4 GPU and MediaTek’s HyperEngine 5.0 enhancements for gaming. The chip’s modem supports sub6 5G networks as well as Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3/LE. Modern features the 7200 further supports includes 4K HDR video recording, cameras up to 200MP, recording videos from two cameras at once, and FHD+ displays at 144Hz. Memory can hit up to 6,400Mbps and UFS 3.1 storage is supported. The MediaTek Dimensity 7200 will debut in new Android smartphones launching in Q1 2023. That’s within the next month, as the quarter ends in March. It seems entirely possible MWC 2023 later this month will see the first Dimensity 7200 devices, but for now we’ll just have to wait and see.

219,"YouTube Kids is coming to main YouTube app on game consoles, smart TVs, Roku",Ben Schoon,2023-02-16 03:16:52,"YouTube Kids has been around for a few years now, and the service is now expanding to more smart TVs through an update to the core YouTube app. The biggest advantage of this is that, finally, YouTube Kids will be available on more popular platforms, including Roku. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Announced this evening via email, but apparently still rolling out, YouTube Kids is coming to more TVs by integrating the experience into the core YouTube app. YouTube says that switching accounts on the main app across smart TVs (Samsung, LG, Roku, etc), game consoles, and more, will launch a YouTube Kids experience for supervised accounts. The full YouTube Kids app is currently available for Samsung, LG , Fire TV , Apple TV , and Android TV/Google TV devices, but this new change expands the option to even more platforms, such as game consoles. The obvious glaring omission for YouTube Kids on TV prior has obviously been Roku, which lacks the official app entirely, so this is certainly a change that many families will be happy to see. YouTube’s announcement, sent via email, reads in full: We are excited to share a new way for your family to enjoy the videos they love on the big screen. When using the YouTube app on a smart TV, streaming device, or gaming console, you will now be able to enter the safer, designed-for-kids YouTube Kids app through your child’s YouTube Kids profile. This change will be rolling out to families over the next few weeks.‌ When on the Accounts tab, you can easily toggle between your profile and your child’s profile, which will take you directly into the YouTube Kids app — with your existing parental controls, content settings, and child’s preferences ready to go. This means a seamless transition from your YouTube profile to your child’s YouTube Kids profile and less navigation with a remote. For simplicity, we will now show your existing YouTube Kids profiles on your Accounts page within the YouTube app on smart TVs, streaming devices, and gaming consoles. If YouTube Kids is no longer the viewing experience you want for your child, you can easily delete those profiles by visiting families.youtube.com, selecting your child’s profile, and clicking on the three-dot menu. Note that deleting the profiles will delete them on all devices.

222,How Google Pixel Watch Fall Detection will work,Abner Li,2023-02-16 02:01:00,"At the start of last month, Pixel Watch Fall Detection appeared for some users , but Google has not rolled it out in an official manner. Ahead of the winter launch deadline , here’s a closer look at how it works. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); About APK Insight: In this “APK Insight” post, we’ve decompiled the latest version of an application that Google uploaded to the Play Store. When we decompile these files (called APKs, in the case of Android apps), we’re able to see various lines of code within that hint at possible future features. Keep in mind that Google may or may not ever ship these features, and our interpretation of what they are may be imperfect. We’ll try to enable those that are closer to being finished, however, to show you how they’ll look in case that they do ship. With that in mind, read on. These strings come from the latest update (version 1.0.5 -> 1.1) to the Google Pixel Watch app, which just hit the 500,000 downloads milestone . During the set-up process, Google explains that Fall Detection “works by using motion sensors on your Pixel Watch,” with the spec sheet noting detection of up to 32 g-forces. You’ll be warned that “high-impact activities may trigger fall detection, and your watch can’t detect all falls.” There are three steps to activation: When a hard fall is detected : After 30 seconds, your Pixel Watch will vibrate, sound an alarm, and check if you need help. If you don’t respond : Your Pixel watch will attempt to contact emergency services. During the emergency call : Your Pixel Watch will play an automated message that provides your location and requests help. You can also speak to the emergency operator if you’re able. The feature should be available in the following countries: AU, CA, FR, GB, IE, JP, TW, US This is what the emergency operator will hear on the other end: “You are being contacted by an automated emergency voice service on behalf of a caller. The caller’s watch detected a possible fall, and they were unresponsive. Please send help. Their location is 12.039578 degrees latitude, -121.947872 degrees longitude. This message will repeat 3 times.” Pixel Watch estimated oxygen variation returns to Fitbit app Meanwhile, version 1.1.0.506033635 also reveals ongoing work on supporting Watch Unlock, which will require Android 13 . The appearance of Fall Detection at the start of last month for owners that reset their Pixel Watch was quite odd, but Google now looks to be lining up these features for launch. A Pixel Watch Feature Drop to coincide with the next one for phones in March makes sense at this point. Thanks to JEB Decompiler , from which some APK Insight teardowns benefit.

224,Pixel Watch estimated oxygen variation returns to Fitbit app,Abner Li,2023-02-16 01:01:16,"For the past few weeks, the Pixel Watch has been missing estimated oxygen variation (EOV) data in the Fitbit app, but the graph is now back. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); 9to5Google has a rebooted newsletter that highlights the biggest Google stories with added commentary and other tidbits. Sign up here ! This metric is an “approximation of the changes in your blood oxygen saturation levels” as you sleep overnight. This graph notes low variation (normal) in green and high, which “can be linked to breathing issues” in orange. The oxygen levels in your blood tend to remain relatively constant, even during exercise and sleep. If you stop breathing or have lung issues, your blood oxygen saturation level can fall as less oxygen enters your body ( source ). You can find it by going to Sleep > tapping a night > Restoration in the Fitbit app. It appears underneath the Sleeping Heart Rate and Restlessness sections. This estimated oxygen variation graph has been missing for the past few weeks, but is now back with Pixel Watch data from that entire gap available. It’s not clear if this was a server-side fix on Fitbit’s part or related to this week’s app update . Update : Not all users are seeing the restored graph. How Google Pixel Watch Fall Detection will work The Pixel Watch measures this by using red and infrared sensors that shine light “onto your skin and blood vessels, using the color of the light that bounces back to approximate how much oxygen is in your blood.” Richly oxygenated blood is red and reflects more red light than infrared light. Poorly oxygenated blood is bluish red and reflects more infrared light than red light. Meanwhile, people are waiting for full blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) capabilities, with Pixel Watch specs noting the presence of such a sensor with this disclaimer : Blood oxygen measurements, when available and enabled, are intended for general fitness and wellness purposes and are not intended to diagnose or treat any medical condition or for any other medical use, including self-diagnosis or consultation with a doctor. Please consult your doctor before beginning or modifying any exercise regimen or making health-related decisions. On Fitbit trackers (including the $99 Inspire 3) and smartwatches, the percentage appears in the Fitbit app. Hopefully, Google will enable this with a future Pixel Watch update.

239,Apple's mixed reality headset will reportedly debut at WWDC in June,I,2023-02-15 22:10:42,"Apple may be narrowing down the launch window for its fabled mixed reality headset . Bloomberg sources say the headset is now set to premiere at the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June. The device, possibly called Reality Pro, was unofficially slated to arrive in April but reportedly needed extra development time to address hardware and software issues. The company has already declined to comment, but the hardware might ship later in the year. The headset is believed to carry a steep price tag, possibly as high as $3,000, but may also include capabilities not found even on alternatives like the Meta Quest Pro . Rumors suggest it could include dual 4K displays and a wide range of cameras that allow advanced tracking and controller-free input.

241,Pixel Buds Pro update readies Spatial Audio settings with head tracking demo,Kyle Bradshaw,2023-02-15 22:01:14,"Google’s Pixel Buds app readies a new settings page to showcase the difference made by enabling head tracking for Spatial Audio on the Pixel Buds Pro. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); About APK Insight: In this “APK Insight” post, we’ve decompiled the latest version of an application that Google uploaded to the Play Store. When we decompile these files (called APKs, in the case of Android apps), we’re able to see various lines of code within that hint at possible future features. Keep in mind that Google may or may not ever ship these features, and our interpretation of what they are may be imperfect. We’ll try to enable those that are closer to being finished, however, to show you how they’ll look in the case that they do ship. With that in mind, read on. For owners of Pixel 6 or Pixel 7 series phones, Spatial Audio arrived in a recent update as a way to make surround sound audio — such as 5.1 or 7.1 audio in movies or TV — more immersive on the Pixel Buds Pro and any wired (USB-C) headphones. Google has also previously confirmed that the Pixel Buds Pro should soon gain support for head tracking, which will take Spatial Audio and make it responsive to your movements. Using a recent update to the Pixel Buds app, our team has managed to forcibly enable Google’s new settings page for Spatial Audio. On Pixel phones, it will appear as a new option on your headset’s “Device details” page. How Google Pixel Watch Fall Detection will work From the new page, you’ll be able to easily enable or disable both Spatial Audio in general and the connected “Head tracking” feature. What’s more interesting that Google will helpfully include a demo video right above the two toggles. It will be a simple nature video with bird calls and orchestral music, all separated out into different directions. Judging from the section’s title, “See how it works,” you’ll likely be able to switch between the Spatial Audio modes of the Pixel Buds Pro and hear the differences using the video as a baseline. This should make it easier for Pixel Buds owners to decide whether Spatial Audio and head tracking are right for them, or if they’d rather stick with traditional stereo sound. With these new settings seemingly ready, it hopefully won’t be much longer before Google fully launches head tracking Spatial Audio for the Pixel Buds Pro. The upcoming March Pixel Feature Drop would be the most obvious opportunity, though the last Pixel Buds update arrived in October , separate from any Pixel Feature Drop.

247,Google reiterates how you can block Calendar spam,Abner Li,2023-02-15 21:34:10,"Last July , Google Calendar introduced an “Only if the sender is known” setting to block invite spam, and the company is now prominently highlighting that option. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); 9to5Google has a rebooted newsletter that highlights the biggest Google stories with added commentary and other tidbits. Sign up here ! In a rare direct email today, “Google Calendar” promotes how it is “now easier to block spam” with the option first announced last year. If you’ve never interacted with someone, their invitations won’t be automatically added to your calendar unless you indicate you do know them. Those considered to be known include senders in your contacts, company, or “someone you previously interacted with.” In a support article, Google explains how with this setting: If an event isn’t added to your calendar, you get the invitation as an email, even if the organizer doesn’t send one. After you mark a sender as known, or you interact with them, future invitations from them are automatically added to your calendar. This option might reveal to senders that they aren’t in your contacts. You can “respond to the invitation sent to you in email” directly, and it’s easy to change the default behavior back to “From everyone” or “When I respond to the invitation in email.” Go to Google Calendar settings on the web > General > Event settings > Add invitations to my calendar. From everyone : All invitations are automatically added to your calendar. Only if the sender is known : Events are added to your calendar if the sender is in your contacts, part of your organization, or someone you previously interacted with. This helps prevent spam on your calendar. When I respond to the invitation in email : An event is added to your calendar only after you respond to the email notification. When an event isn’t added to your calendar, you get an invitation by email, even if the event organizer chooses not to send one. Meanwhile, another avenue of spam on Android is “untrusted third party apps” adding spammy events to Calendar.

If horror icons like Freddy Krueger and Pyramid Head aren’t your thing, you can turn to more original additions like Ji-woon , a K-pop star turned serial killer. The game’s newest killer fits in that latter mold. Adriana Imai, aka The Skull Merchant, is a wealthy tech executive who, when she’s not eliminating competition like any good monopolist, uses the skulls of her past victims to craft aerial drones to hunt her next kill. A bit on the nose? Definitely, but she looks to add something new to a game that has been around since 2016. The Skull Merchant’s power, Eyes in the Sky, allows her to send up to four drones to scout for the survivors she’s tasked with eliminating. Once Imai finds her targets, she can use a hand claw to eliminate them. Alongside Imai, Dead by Daylight developer Behavior Interactive is adding two new survivors as part of the game’s upcoming “Tools of Torment” update. Thalita and Renato Lyra are siblings who hail from Brazil. Before they had the misfortune of being tossed into the hellscape that is Dead by Daylight's world, Thalita and Renato owned a kite-flying business that mentored kids in their local community. The two come with teamwork perks that prompt cooperative play. Tools of Torment won’t introduce a new map, but it will come with a tweak to the game’s existing Shelter Woods arena that adds The Skull Merchant’s hunting ground. You can play the update starting on March 7th when it arrives on PC and consoles.",technology,252

The Wall Street Journal has learned that House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan has subpoenaed the CEOs of Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta and Microsoft for information on their content moderation methods. The leaders have until March 23rd to provide any communications between them and the federal government's executive branch on the subject. Jordan's panel wants to know ""how and to what extent"" the federal government allegedly pressured and coordinated with companies to censor content. The requests include details about people responsible for shaping moderation policies as well as those who've talked to the executive branch. Like numerous Republican politicians, Jordan has long maintained that major tech companies censor conservative views under the guise of curbing hate speech and misinformation. The representative notably didn't subpoena Twitter, which he likely feels is more supportive of right-wing views with Elon Musk at the helm . The social network recently reinstated Donald Trump's account (still inactive), and has been sharing internal ""Twitter Files"" that covered the company's sharing limits on a New York Post story on Hunter Biden as well as the decision to ban Trump following the January 6th, 2021 attack on the Capitol. While right-wing figures have portrayed the disclosure as proof of anti-conservative censorship, critics have argued the documents don't offer substantially new details, don't provide evidence of conspiracy and were given only to writers likely to share Musk's views.

Whether or not the House panel can take action is another matter. Attempts to prove an anti-conservative bias have failed so far, with multiple studies showing no evidence of these leanings.

The Committee is seeking documents and commucations from the CEOs of Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Microsoft to see if the companies worked with the federal government to censor content on their platforms. The Committee says it has repeatedly attempted to work with the companies since December, but they did not ""adequately comply"" with the requests. The subpoenas require Sundar Pichai, Andy Jassy, Tim Cook, Mark Zuckberg, and Satya Nadella to turn over all requested documents and communications by March 23, 2023. According to The Wall Street Journal , it's a probe to determine if the companies censored viewpoints on issues such as COVID-19 policy that disagreed with White House policy. However, in November, Apple CEO met with GOP lawmakers that included Ohio's Jim Jordan, California's Darrel Issa, and Washington's Cathy McMorris Rogers. At the time, it wasn't clear what was on the agenda. Notably, the Committee didn't request information from Twitter CEO Elon Musk, even though it's a popular social network. However, Jordan has publicly voiced his support for Musk in the past. Many Republicans have claimed that Big Tech companies limit speech from conservatives on their platforms, stifling their views on various topics. For example, Senator Josh Hawley (R-MO) wrote an open letter to Cook, accusing Apple of helping China to suppress free speech. ""[U]nder your leadership, Apple has time and again assisted the Chinese Communist Party in surveilling and suppressing the basic human rights of the Chinese people,"" he wrote. ""At the same time, it appears that Apple might be importing this model of speech control to the United States: reports indicate that your company might deplatform Twitter from the App Store as a consequence of the free speech policies implemented by new ownership."" But Apple reportedly never considered removing Twitter from the App Store, although there was some public concern that the company intended to.

261,"How AI will change the way we search, for better or worse",I,2023-02-15 20:00:21,"G reat news everyone, we’re pivoting to chatbots! Little did OpenAI realize when it released ChatGPT last November that the advanced LLM (large language model) designed to uncannily mimic human writing would become the fastest growing app to date with more than 100 million users signing up over the past three months. Its success — helped along by a $10 billion, multi-year investment from Microsoft — largely caught the company’s competition flat-footed, in turn spurring a frenetic and frantic response from Google , Baidu and Alibaba . But as these enhanced search engines come online in the coming days, the ways and whys of how we search are sure to evolve alongside them. “I'm pretty excited about the technology. You know, we've been building NLP systems for a while and we've been looking every year at incremental growth,” Dr. Sameer Singh , Associate Professor of Computer Science at the University of California, Irvine (UCI), told Engadget. “For the public, it seems like suddenly out of the blue, that's where we are. I've seen things getting better over the years and it's good for all of this stuff to be available everywhere and for people to be using it.” As to the recent public success of large language models, “I think it's partly that technology has gotten to a place where it's not completely embarrassing to put the output of these models in front of people — and it does look really good most of the time,” Singh continued. “I think that that’s good enough.” Turn on browser notifications to receive breaking news alerts from Engadget You can disable notifications at any time in your settings menu. Not now Turn on Turned on Turn on JASON REDMOND via Getty Images “I think it has less to do with technology but more to do with the public perception,” he continued. “If GPT hadn't been released publicly… Once something like that is out there and it's really resonating with so many people, the usage is off the charts.” Search providers have big, big ideas for how the artificial intelligence-enhanced web crawlers and search engines might work and damned if they aren’t going to break stuff and move fast to get there. Microsoft envisions its Bing AI to serve as the user’s “ copilot ” in their web browsing, following them from page to page answering questions and even writing social media posts on their behalf. This is a fundamental change from the process we use today. Depending on the complexity of the question users may have to visit multiple websites, then sift through that collected information and stitch it together into a cohesive idea before evaluating it. “That's more work than having a model that hopefully has read these pages already and can synthesize this into something that doesn't currently exist on the web,” Brendan Dolan-Gavitt , Assistant Professor in the Computer Science and Engineering Department at NYU Tandon, told Engadget. “The information is still out there. It's still verifiable, and hopefully correct. But it's not all in place.” For its part, Google’s vision of the AI-powered future has users hanging around its search page rather than clicking through to destination sites. Information relevant to the user’s query would be collected from the web, stitched together by the language model, then regurgitated as an answer with reference to the originating website displayed as footnotes. This all sounds great, and was all going great, right up to the very first opportunity for something to go wrong. When it did. In its inaugural Twitter ad — less than 24 hours after debuting — Bard, Google’s answer to ChatGPT, confidently declared , “JWST took the very first pictures of a planet outside of our own solar system.” You will be shocked to learn that the James Webb Space Telescope did not, in fact, discover the first exoplanet in history. The ESO’s Very Large Telescope holds that honor from 2004. Bard just sorta made it up. Hallucinated it out of the digital ether. Bard is an experimental conversational AI service, powered by LaMDA. Built using our large language models and drawing on information from the web, it’s a launchpad for curiosity and can help simplify complex topics → https://t.co/fSp531xKy3 pic.twitter.com/JecHXVmt8l — Google (@Google) February 6, 2023 Of course this isn’t the first time that we’ve been lied to by machines. Search has always been a bit of a crapshoot, ever since the early days of Lycos and Altavista. “When search was released, we thought it was ‘good enough’ though it wasn't perfect,” Singh recalled. “It would give all kinds of results. Over time, those have improved a lot. We played with it, and we realized when we should trust it and when we shouldn’t — when we should go to the second page of results, and when we shouldn't.” The subsequent generation of voice AI assistants evolved through the same base issues that their text-based predecessors did. “When Siri and Google Assistant and all of these came out and Alexa,” Singh said, “they were not the assistants that they were being sold to us as.” The performance of today’s LLMs like Bard and ChatGPT, are likely to improve along similar paths through their public use, as well as through further specialization into specific technical and knowledge-based roles such as medicine, business analysis and law. “I think there are definitely reasons it becomes much better once you start specializing it. I don't think Google and Microsoft specifically are going to be specializing it too much — their market is as general as possible,” Singh noted. In many ways, what Google and Bing are offering by interposing their services in front of the wider internet — much as AOL did with the America Online service in the ‘90s — is a logical conclusion to the challenges facing today’s internet users. The Washington Post via Getty Images “Nobody's doing the search as the end goal. We are seeking some information, eventually to act on that information,” Singh argues. “If we think about that as the role of search, and not just search in the literal sense of literally searching for something, you can imagine something that actually acts on top of search results can be very useful.” Singh characterizes this centralization of power as, “a very valid concern. Simply put, if you have these chat capabilities, you are much less inclined to actually go to the websites where this information resides,” he said. It’s bad enough that chatbots have a habit of making broad intellectual leaps in their summarizations, but the practice may also “incentivize users not go to the website, not read the whole source, to just get the version that the chat interface gives you and sort of start relying on it more and more,” Singh warned. In this, Singh and Dolan-Gavitt agree. “If you’re cannibalizing from the visits that a site would have gotten, and are no longer directing people there, but using the same information, there's an argument that these sites won't have much incentive to keep posting new content.” Dolan-Gavitt told Engadget. “On the other hand the need for clicks also is one of the reasons we get lots of spam and is one of the reasons why search has sort of become less useful recently. I think [the shortcomings of search are] a big part of why people are responding more positively to these chatbot products.” That demand, combined with a nascent marketplace, is resulting in a scramble among the industry’s major players to get their products out yesterday, ready or not, underwhelming or not. That rush for market share is decidedly hazardous for consumers. Microsoft’s previous foray into AI chatbots, 2014’s Taye, ended poorly (to put it without the white hoods and goose stepping). Today, Redditors are already jailbreaking OpenAI to generate racist content. These are two of the more innocuous challenges we will face as LLMs expand in use but even they have proven difficult to stamp out in part, because they require coordination amongst an industry of viscous competitors. “The kinds of things that I tend to worry about are, on the software side, whether this puts malicious capabilities into more hands, makes it easier for people to write malware and viruses,” Dolan-Gavitt said. “This is not as extreme as things like misinformation but certainly, I think it'll make it a lot easier for people to make spam.” “A lot of the thinking around safety so far has been predicated on this idea that there would be just a couple kinds of central companies that, if you could get them all to agree, we could have some safety standards.” Dolan-Gavitt continued. “I think the more competition there is, the more you get this open environment where you can download an unrestricted model, set it up on your server and have it generate whatever you want. The kinds of approaches that relied on this more centralized model will start to fall apart.”",technology,261

Most of the AppleInsider staff used Zip disks in their heyday. For those that didn't, they were portable magnetic media a bit larger than a floppy disk that slotted into a relatively inexpensive drive. Most of the major manufacturers adopted them as at least an option. Apple did too. But for many reasons, they faded into obscurity. Data density was one issue, and so was reliability on not just it, but its larger cousin, the Jaz drive. And, they were mostly replaced with flash drives. Fast forward about two decades to today, and SanDisk has resurrected the idea of removable media in a custom enclosure with the idea of the flash drive, resulting in the SanDisk Professional Pro-Blade Transport system. The Pro-Blade ecosystem revolves around high-speed SSD ""Mags,"" which are slimline and lightweight, and hold the actual media. To interface them with your Mac, you at a minimum need the SanDisk Pro-Blade Transport. That enclosure is effectively the main enclosure for an external drive, but without the drive itself. The theory is that you have one or relatively few Transports, but lots of SSD Mags. Tried and true model, once upon a time. Pro-Blade Transport Of the two types of component, the Transport is the bit that connects to your Mac. The SSD Mag fits into the Transport, which in turn communicates to the Mac. In effect, the Transport is a specialized hard drive docking station or ""toaster."" Except it's in a much smaller form. The slot of the Pro-Blade Transport where you place the SSD Mags Made from aluminum complete with an aluminum heatsink to help cool the SSD Mags, the Transport is a relatively straightforward docking element. On one end is the slot where the SSD Mag fits in, along with an indicator light. The slot is made so that you can easily insert and pull out the SSD Mag, so that you can quickly switch between Mags without too much interference. At the other end is just one port, a USB-C 3.2 Gen 2x2 connection with up to 20Gbps of bandwidth available to use. That is, assuming your Mac supports it — more on this in a bit. There's a 20Gbps USB-C port to connect the Pro-Blade Transport to your Mac. As an enclosure, it's also reasonably sized at 5.13 inches long, 2.82 inches wide, and 0.63 inches thick. It's fairly lightweight when empty at 0.46 pounds. This is still much bigger than the recent crop of NVMe USB-C enclosures. It can be used on both Macs and Windows, with support for macOS 10.13 or later and Windows 10, though you will have to reformat the Mags. For the former, it is compatible with Time Machine, though admittedly this is better suited for work-use drives rather than backups. Pro-Blade SSD Mags The actual storage bit of the system, the SSD Mags are long, thin slabs of aluminum with SanDisk branding in the middle. At one end is a divot to help grip the Mag when it's in the slot. The other end has the connector that couples to its counterpart deep inside the Transport. It will also work with the Pro-Blade Station, a more enhanced form of the Transport that can take up to four Mags. However, this isn't a standard connector that will work outside of the system itself. You cannot directly connect the drive alone to your Mac, you must use the Transport. Each Mag is very light at a tenth of a pound each. They're not quite as long at 4.32 inches, but they're also a lot thinner and narrower at 1.1 inches and 0.2 inches. The SSD Mag's connector. Despite their size, SanDisk worked to make each one durable. Away from the Transport, each blade can withstand a 3-meter (9.8ft) drop, and can survive being crushed by a 4,000-pound weight. We did run one over with our minivan, and it survived, intact and readable. Scuffed, but intact. So far, there are four different capacities of Pro-Blade SSD Mag available, including 1TB, 2TB, and 4TB versions, and all using NVMe storage Assisted by the aluminum enclosure and the heatsink in the Transport, the SSD Mag is capable of read speeds of up to 2,000 megabytes per second. Our testing bore this out. Read speeds on a M2 Max MacBook Pro routinely hit 1.92 gigabytes per second, and read speeds generally hovered at 1.86 gigabytes per second. We didn't see a significant decrease in speed over time. After we had some questions about it, we tested on a M1 Max MacBook Pro. On those units USB-C connections are limited to 10 gigabits per second, versus the 20 that USB 3.2 2x2 provides, and 40, that Thunderbolt is capable of. On the M1 Mac, we only got about a gigabyte per second read and write, half that on the new MacBook Pro. Curious, we ripped one apart. The enclosure is held together with a trio of T5 screws, and a pile of thermal compound connecting the drive and the enclosure. Inside the 2TB capacity Mag is a tiny bridge board with a Mag connector, and a Western Digital SN750 NVMe SSD with 2GB of cache. In theory, that drive could push over 3 gigabytes per second, and did when we moved it to a Thunderbolt enclosure. But, it can only push this much data for about 12GB of transfer. After that, speeds in the Thunderbolt enclosure dropped to about 1.6 gigabytes per second. So, with that 20 gigabit USB-C connection on new machines, and certainly the 10 gigabit connection on M1 and older Macs, you are assured of steady-state performance at the claimed speeds. A space-saving solution for professional users SanDisk provided us two carriers and a few Mags for testing. We didn't get to test out the four-Mag $499 Pro-Blade Station, as it does not appear to ship until March. For the average user, the SanDisk Professional Pro-Blade modular storage system is overkill. Even Mac power users will have quite some trouble justifying this sort of purchase, and it's not because of the price. Buying each Mag individually costs $179.99 for 1TB, $299.99 for 2TB, and $599.99 for 4TB, which is fairly reasonable when compared with the general NVMe market. The Transport costs $69.99 on its own, which is pretty good for a storage-free component. There are bundles available of the Transport with each SSD Mag capacity, starting at $239.99 for 1TB then rising to $349.99 for 2TB and $579.99 for 4TB. SanDisk Professional's Pro-Blade system is great for creative fields. The nosebleed pricing of NVMe is justified by its blisteringly fast performance, which is reasonable on its own, especially if you have the need for it. It's more than enough for almost anyone to be able to work directly from the external drive without any real issues. The problematic bit is that this is a modular storage system with an extremely specific set of purposes in mind. It's to cut down the overall size of external storage if you need to use mountains of drives, and it's to make it as easy as possible to switch between physical drives. The average user and even the ""prosumer"" has other, better options. However, videographers and the like working from the drive directly and using each one per project can then physically hand over to someone else, which is good from a flexibility standpoint. And, they're easy to store and label. For that purpose, the SanDisk Professional Pro-Blade Transport and SSD Mags are a useful tool for data storage involving multiple drives. For other users, more traditional external storage drives are a better and more cost-effective than Mags and Transports. Looking to the future, though, is where the Pro-Blade has potential. The Pro-Blade Station is a good start, with Thunderbolt connectivity. If peripherals like the Pro Blade or some kind of Thunderbolt dock incorporating the Mags, with more ports and monitor connectivity becomes more ubiquitous, paired with adoption in devices that demand high speeds like video cameras, then we see a bright future for the technology. Until then, though, we're not sure who's asking for this solution today, and there are better solutions for the M1 series of Macs. We'll revisit this in the future. SanDisk Pro-Blade Transport Pros High-speed transfers Quick switching between Mags Compact size considering the use of multiple drives Premium aluminum styling Great for video editors SanDisk Pro-Blade Transport Cons Overkill and too costly for most users Not full 20 gbit/sec speed on anything but the newest 2023 MacBook Pro Non-standard connector limits use of SSD Mags outside of the ecosystem Rating: 3 out of 5 Where to buy Get the SanDisk Pro-Blade Transport with a 1TB SSD for $169.99, including a limited-time $70 discount. That reduced price is available from B&H or Amazon at the time of this publication.

Goldman CEO David Solomon had wanted the bank to increase its efforts to develop financial services for consumers, such as its Marcus savings account and a planned digital checking account. It also partnered with Apple to launch the consumer Apple Card . A Goldman-branded credit card would have been the next consumer offering, but a report from CNBC says that the launch of the card has been dropped as the bank deals with losses in its consumer division. For example, it posted a $1.2 billion loss in 2022 driven mainly by loan-loss provisions. But the Apple Card was also a factor, as Goldman spent a lot of money to launch the card and its other consumer services. The losses are probably also factoring into the delayed launch of the Apple savings account that the company announced in October. Another reason for the delay might be ongoing investigations from the Federal Reserve and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. An idea of a Goldman credit card reportedly happened in October 2021 asked Solomon about his consumer product roadmap. For example, the bank could've used the Apple Card system infrastructure for the card. When an analyst inquired about Solomon's consumer product roadmap in October 2021, the concept of a Goldman card reportedly surfaced. According to Solomon, one idea was to share the card technology developed to service Apple Card customers with the Goldman card system. However, a spokesperson for Goldman Sachs said it didn't move further than discussions. ""The idea of a consumer-facing proprietary Goldman Sachs credit card was discussed but never became a meaningful part of our strategy."" The move to launch a Goldman credit card would likely be more expensive than a partnership with Apple since it would have to foot the bill by itself to acquire customers and attract their interest with rewards.

271,DOJ reportedly escalates Apple antitrust probe,Thomas Barrabi,2023-02-15 19:07:00,"Justice Department officials have intensified efforts to develop a potential antitrust complaint targeting Apple, according to a report Wednesday. While the antitrust probe into Apple’s business began in 2019, the DOJ has “escalated” the effort by adding more lawyers to the case and making new requests for relevant documents and consultations with impacted companies, the Wall Street Journal reported , citing people familiar with the matter. The DOJ’s probe is centered on whether the Tim Cook-run tech titan has engaged in anticompetitive business practices. Investigators are reportedly exploring Apple’s policies toward third-party apps on its devices and whether its IOS operating system favors its own software products over those developed by other firms. The department is also assessing the extent to which Jonathan Kanter, the assistant attorney general for the DOJ’s antitrust division, should be involved in the Apple probe. Kanter was reportedly “sidelined” due to his past work representing clients who accused Apple of having anti-competitive business practices, but sources told the Journal that the department has since analyzed whether he should be permitted to oversee the case and will likely clear him to participate. The Justice Department declined to comment. Apple did not immediately return a request for comment. Shares of Apple were up about 1% in intraday trading Wednesday.

Antitrust scrutiny of Apple and other Big Tech giants have intensified in recent years, with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle vowing to crackdown on firms accused of suppressing competition. Criticism of Apple’s business practices have largely focused on its App Store, where the company takes a 30% fee on paid downloads and in-app purchases for developers that earn $1 million or more in annual revenue. Apple has argued its practices encourage competition in the online marketplace, where outside developers compete with its own products. The App Store has faced criticism from the likes of Elon Musk, who likened it to a “30% tax on the internet ” last year, and from Fortnite creator Epic Games, which waged a high-profile legal battle against Apple that ended in a split verdict . The scope of the DOJ’s probe purportedly extends beyond the App Store to an exploration of whether Apple is using iOS to boost both its software and hardware products at the expense of rivals. Apple has limited access to iOS, its messaging platform iMessage and other apps to its own iPhones. The DOJ has a pair of pending lawsuits against Google.

In 2020, the DOJ state attorneys general launched an antitrust investigation into Apple's App Store after developers raised concerns over anticompetitive behavior. Now, according to The Wall Street Journal, the justice department is drafting a potential antitrust complaint against Apple. The department is looking to involve its top antitrust official, Jonathan Kanter. Initially, they'd planned on keeping Kanter on the sideline as he'd previously represented clients who had accused Apple of anticompetitive behavior. In August, the Department of Justice was reportedly constructing an antitrust lawsuit against Apple. The suit was primarily focused on complaints from Tile, a direct competitor of Apple's AirTag . This is far from the only antitrust battle Apple is fighting. For example, the European Union's Digital Markets Act and Digital Services Act is a proposal intended to place additional restrictions and mandate new frameworks for digital service ""gatekeepers."" In July, Russia's federal antimonopoly service (FAS) intended to fine Apple for allegedly violating the country's antitrust laws, claiming the App Store is being used to control the iOS app marketplace. Individual companies, such as Match Group, owner of the popular dating app Tinder, have also filed antitrust cases against Apple.

274,Tesla finally agrees to open its charging network to all EVs in US,Ashley Belanger,2023-02-15 18:51:46,"Enlarge Tom Williams / Contributor | CQ-Roll Call, Inc. reader comments 144 with Share this story Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Reddit Today, the Biden administration announced new standards for expanding the national electric vehicle (EV) charging network in order to encourage widespread EV adoption by providing a ""predictable"" user experience. All charging stations will soon be required to adopt the same connector types, payment methods, and data privacy assurances. These new standards have pushed Tesla, for the first time, to make part of its proprietary charging network compatible with non-Tesla EVs in the United States. Joining other industry stakeholders in supporting Biden’s goal to build 500,000 EV chargers nationwide by 2030 , Tesla has pledged to make ""at least 7,500 chargers available for all EVs by the end of 2024,"" Biden’s announcement said. This will include 3,500 new and existing 250 kW ""superchargers"" along highway corridors and 4,000 slower “destination chargers” at hotels and restaurants in urban and rural areas. Any EV driver should be able to use the Tesla app or website to access these charging stations, but it’s currently unclear how Tesla will adapt its charging network to comply with new connector-type standards. The most widely used connector type is the Combined Charging System (CCS) , and Reuters reported that any company hoping to secure a portion of $7.5 billion in federal funding for Biden’s EV initiative would have to adopt the CCS standard. A White House official said that Tesla would be adopting the CCS standard, already has ""a hardware and a software solution"" to do so, and could qualify for state funding to retrofit its charger network, Reuters reported . Earlier this year, InsideEVs reported that Tesla’s solution could be a mysterious “Magic Dock” to retrofit Tesla charging stations to charge non-Tesla EVs. No one's sure exactly how the Magic Dock would work yet. Advertisement Opening its charging network to all EVs could position Tesla as the clear industry leader across America, analysts told Reuters, but adopting the CCS standard could also diminish some consumers’ incentive to buy Teslas. Tesla drivers have enjoyed exclusive access to the nation’s largest and fastest network of “superchargers,” but soon any EV owner can enjoy that same benefit without buying a Tesla. Tesla did not respond to Ars’ request for comment. Despite this seeming risk to its EV sales, Tesla CEO Elon Musk seemed ""very open"" to helping Biden meet his ambitious EV charging goals, White House Infrastructure Coordinator Mitch Landrieu said at a press briefing today. With so much funding available to competitors, Tesla otherwise might have risked a rival creating a larger charging network, thus losing Tesla drivers’ incentive of exclusivity either way. When Musk met with White House officials last month, he made no commitment to opening up the charging network, The Washington Post reported . Today’s announcement will likely be good news to at least some of Tesla’s investors, who, Reuters reported, have been waiting for Tesla to confirm its commitment. Is Biden’s made-in-America plan realistic? Tesla isn’t the only company that Biden is relying on to expand the country’s EV charging network through the Department of Transportation’s (DOT) National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program. More than a dozen companies have committed to adding ""more than 100,000 public chargers available for all EVs."" Those companies include automakers like General Motors , Mercedes-Benz , Volvo , and Ford, as well as other EV industry stakeholders, including Hertz, BP, Pilot Company, EVgo , TravelCenters of America, ChargePoint, Electrify America, and Starbucks. General Motors and Francis Energy made some of the largest commitments. The former promised to install ""up to 40,000 public Level 2 EV chargers in local communities by 2026"" and the latter to expand into 40 states by 2023 and then install ""50,000 EV charging ports by 2030."" Other companies and networks made commitments to regularly maintain new charging stations. Advertisement While the NEVI program helps Biden achieve his mission of electrifying ""the great American road trip,"" Biden’s larger goal is to aggressively ramp up domestic manufacturing of EVs and EV chargers. To that end, Biden’s plan requires that all federally funded EV chargers must be built in the US. Companies have until July 2024 to ensure that 55 percent of the cost of all components for new EV chargers is paid to domestic manufacturers. Any equipment that doesn’t meet that standard must be installed by October 2024. Biden expects that requiring continued investments will support the development of a dependable domestic supply chain. ""These standards will direct federal dollars to build out a national EV charging network that is user-friendly, reliable, and accessible so that charging is as easy as filling up at a gas station,"" Biden’s announcement said. Not everyone expects that Biden’s plan will result in America suddenly gaining a dependable supply chain, though. Reuters reported that the European Union and Mexico have voiced concerns that the US is discriminating against foreign EV makers, and states told DOT that the global demand for EV chargers is already straining the supply chain—making it hard to speed up charger manufacturing while meeting new made-in-America standards. Tesla is worried that the ""pace and scale of deployment"" of Biden's plan is too ambitious and could create a ""shortfall in the number of compliant charging stations.""",technology,274

For years, the service—which had Google roll into a town, lay down miles of fiber-optic cable, and start competing with the local ISP monopoly—had "" paused "" further expansion. Now, for whatever reason, Fiber is back, and the company is offering a new high of 5 gigabits per second. Of course the downside to Google Fiber is always the very limited rollout area. Google says 5 Gig service is coming to "" Kansas City , West Des Moines , and all our Utah cities ,"" and that's it. Google Fiber announced plans last year to roll out to five new states eventually but has no plans to ever reach a wide rollout. If you live in one of the blessed Fiber cities, the service sounds great, though. That's 5Gbps symmetrical, so 5Gbps download and upload speeds, which is a massive improvement over something like Comcast and its ~ 35MB upload speeds . If you're a content creator, developer, or, especially, someone who regularly generates 4K video, normal ISP upload speeds can be crippling. Google's 5Gbps service is $125 a month, which includes a professionally installed 10 Gig fiber modem and ""a Wi-Fi 6 router and two mesh extenders.""

The company notes you can bring your own equipment instead, and you probably should, since all models of Nest WiFi only have a 1 gigabit Ethernet port for the modem hookup, which will be a major bottleneck in a 5 gigabit Internet setup. Correctly feeding 5Gbps into a Wi-Fi setup—and even a wired setup—means you're going to have to be really picky about your equipment. The 10 Gig modem is a sign of Google's plans to push Google Fiber even further. The company says ""8 Gig is on the horizon""—a reference to a previously announced plan to launch a $150 service tier in ""early 2023.""

According to Hillmann, Binance rose rapidly in a decentralized cryptocurrency environment and was developed by software engineers who were far from familiar with the intricate regulatory rules related to anti-money laundering and terrorist financing. He talked about small compliance ""gaps"" that might occur over the years. However, they have either already been patched or are currently being fixed. Despite this, it expects US regulators to impose financial penalties on the company for past actions. Binance is currently working closely with regulators, including the Department of Justice ( ) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ( ), to determine the immediate remedies to be taken first.

281,"DeFi Starts 2023 with a Jump, but Will the Momentum Last?",Solomon Oladipupo,2023-02-16 12:34:20,"After , the cryptocurrency industry started out this year full of hope for a better turnout. Users' and investors’ confidence in the market was battered by the various events that marked the industry last year. However, Bitcoin (BTC), the largest digital currency, gained significant traction last month. At the start of the year, the price of BTC stood at $16,500. However, by January 30, the price surged by 45% to about $23,955, giving investors hope for better days ahead for the industry. This price rally is also reflected in the decentralized finance (DeFi) industry. reports that the DeFi market saw its tokens, minus stablecoins and wrapped tokens, “with various governance and losing over $48.4 billion in value.” The stablecoin market, for its part, decreased by 16.6% to $27.3 billion by year-end. However, a new dataset collated by shows that the total number of DeFi users increased by 35% year-over-year to 6.7 million in January 2023. Furthermore, analysis by Dune Analytics reveals that the total number of users engaging in DeFi projects skyrocketed from about 110,000 users three years ago to 4.96 million users in January 2022. In fact, by the end of last year, over 1.8 million new users had joined the DeFi industry. The data also shows that this number increased to 6.77 million users in January 2023. Andrew Thurman, the Head of Content at Nansen, a blockchain analytics platform, explained that inspired a double-digit growth in users and activities for many DeFi protocols “despite plummeting as Alameda and other major funds withdrew.” “I think DeFi was a major beneficiary of the ‘not your keys, not your coins’ narrative. While DeFi has its own risk profile, with threats such as exploits looming, a growing number of users want to leverage on-chain financial services rather than centralized alternatives,” Thurman told . However, while the total number of DeFi users increased year-over-year in 2022, there was no commensurate growth in the sector’s market capitalization, which was struggling to rise above the levels last seen in 2021. Although the market cap increased from $113.4 billion in January 2022 to $166.4 billion in April, the figure declined to $51.8 billion in May and is yet to recover. Brandon Tucker, Growth Lead at Marinade Finance, the creator of the mSOL token, noted that “a lot of the market cap of 2021 was due to over-leveraged large actors like or FTX.” As of December 2022, the DeFi market cap stood at $29.9 billion, showing further declines in the industry. However, this number recovered to $44.8 billion in January 2023, which is a growth of 50% month-over-month. Regardless, compared to the market cap achieved in January 2022, the number is still 60% down. Houston Morgan, the Marketing Director of ShapeShift, a Switzerland-based crypto exchange, believes that users are possibly being more cautious with their investments in the DeFi space due to the market downturn and volatility. Nansen's Thurman also holds the same view. “During 2022, DeFi had to compete with declining crypto asset prices and often in excess of 4%. Few investors wanted their funds in assets like ETH, and while they could earn yield with stablecoins, off-chain yields were more attractive,” Thurman explained. Furthermore, Thurman believes that once the total amount of stablecoins on chain begins to rise again, and withdrawals appear to have flattened, investors are likely to want their dollars on chain and in DeFi rather than in traditional asset alternatives. In recent years, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have come to play an important role in the DeFi industry . However, in recent months, NFT trading volumes have been , except in December last year when the market experienced a short-lived spike after ex-President Donald Trump launched an NFT collection. Although market observers reported that trading prices in the NFT market , there are concerns about the slower pace at which new participants are joining the market. Despite these, Thurman says DeFi will continue to be “a hotbed of innovation and growth in a new bull market” as DeFi provides an alternative to centralized financial institutions and positively impacts the average user. “I expect the rise of , in particular, to lead to a new class of products as developers experiment with yield-bearing liquid staking derivatives (LSDs),” the Nansen executive told . On the other hand, Morgan noted that it is impossible to predict the future of the DeFi industry “with certainty” as factors such as regulatory developments, technological advancements, and market sentiment “will likely play a role in determining its trajectory.” Regardless, the ShapeShift executive expects continued DeFi growth. ""DeFi is likely to continue growing in the larger cryptocurrency market, but its relative importance may vary based on market conditions and . However, as DeFi continues to mature, it will become an increasingly significant part of the larger cryptocurrency market. I see the largest room for growth in the area of liquid staking and cross-chain decentralized application (DApp) aggregators like ShapeShift taking prevalence,"" Morgan explained. With the wider cryptocurrency industry yet to fully recover from the shock of 2022, most experts expect greater regulatory interference by government actors this year. This likely development, factored in with the increasing number of DeFi users spurred by the failure of centralized exchanges last year, means that it remains to be seen what turn the DeFi industry will take in 2023.",top,281

285,What is The Real Housewives of New Jersey Season 13 Episode 3 Release Date?,Preeti Rana,2023-02-16 11:00:37,"The Real Housewives of New Jersey Season 13 Episode 3 Release Date: The release date for The Real Housewives of New Jersey Season 13 Episode 3 is imminent. The series illuminates the lives of a group of affluent ladies living in the New Jersey region of New York City. Throughout the series, we see how the women must balance their incredibly hectic schedules and filming requirements with their chaotic personal lives. This is exactly what makes the show so captivating to watch. The first two episodes of the thirteenth season have only lately begun broadcasting on television. Before moving on to the fresh details of the episode, let’s take a look at a brief summary. With the premiere of the first episode of the season, fans were relieved to have a clean slate with no drama yet in the season, as Potomac and Salt Lake City had been involved in some really ugly situations. New Jersey feels very different from the other shows due to the fact that the women on this programme are much happier than those on the other shows, and the atmosphere is always bright and joyful. Their husbands are more involved in the filming, and their group interactions are slightly more entertaining than the others. Dolores is currently dating a man named Paul. Frank also has a new girlfriend. Traci Johnson and Tiki Barber have opted to spend more time together, resulting in a reunion at the beginning of the show, which we do not object to. The Real Housewives of New Jersey Season 13 Episode 1 And 2 Recap Additionally, new cast members were included as housewives’ pals. The first person we encountered was Jennifer Thessler, whose name has since been changed to Jent. Among the newcomers is Rachel, who is 32 years old at present. She is a mother, and her child is Melissa’s son’s best friend. This time, Teresa brought a buddy to the screen as well. Her name is Danielle. This is how they know each other: they have a long-standing family relationship. This introduction chapter introduced us to everyone who will be invited to parties this season, despite the fact that half of them dislike the other half. Being a member of this fat family and friend circle is so endearing that we have never seen it on any Housewives show. New Jersey is exactly what we would expect from a housewife’s show, complete with trivial disagreements and cold conflicts. People gossip about one another, harbour grudges, and then return home. The one thing that may annoy some viewers, such as me, is that these men have not moved on from their disagreements from the previous season. They continue to quarrel over the same issue. Similar to women, we recognise your distinctions, but we need fresh ones to continue. Currently, it is becoming increasingly difficult. Teresa and Gorgas are still at war, and neither Dolores nor Jennifer are on speaking terms with one another. Margaret and Teresa also dislike each other for some reason, but this issue is so stale that we need something new. The Real Housewives of New Jersey Season 13 Cast This season, two new women have joined the chaos: Danielle Cabral and Rachel Futura. The owner of the shoe business F Major, Jennifer Fessler, will also be introduced as a “new acquaintance.” Read More The Real Housewives of New Jersey Season 13 Episode 3 Release Date Boys Will Be Boys is the title of this episode.

287,Tornado Cash Developer To Remain In Jail As Trial Continues,Amara Khatri,2023-02-16 10:30:00,"Authorities arrested Pertsev in the Netherlands after the United States of America announced sanctions against the crypto privacy tool. A Dutch court has ruled that Alexey Pertsev, who was in the Netherlands after the United States sanctioned the crypto privacy tool Tornado Cash, will remain in the custody of the authorities until the next hearing. With the next hearing scheduled for the 21st of April, 2023, Pertsev is set to remain behind bars for at least another three months as his trial on money laundering charges continues. Furthermore, the court has a pre-trial review on the 24th of May, 2023. According to the panel of judges hearing the case at the East Brabant Court, the Russian web developer could flee or look to hide evidence if released on bail. Pertsev, on his part, has denied the charges leveled against him. Pertsev’s arrest came soon after the United States Treasury announced sanctions against Tornado Cash. The US authorities alleged that the crypto mixing service was facilitating the laundering of funds by malicious entities and hackers, including a hacking group that the FBI believes has links to North Korea. Tornado Cash is an open-source protocol that allows users to pool in their crypto funds with others. It advocates the privacy of user funds and mixes and pools user funds within multiple wallets, thus helping to obfuscate the inflow and outflow of funds and helping anonymize transactions. To sum it up, the FBI has accused Tornado Cash of laundering $7 billion worth of funds. This figure includes the $455 million stolen by the infamous North Korea-linked Lazarus Group. Meanwhile, the Dutch Ministry of Finance has accused Pertsev of “concealing criminal financial flows and facilitating money laundering through Tornado Cash. However, Pertsev has not yet been formally charged with committing any crime. However, he is being detained for 110-day intervals under a provision in Dutch law that allows authorities to hold the accused without formally being charged by the authorities. Furthermore, Pertsev has also seen three appeals rejected by the court since his arrest. The latest appeal was denied as recently as November 2022. Against this backdrop, support for Pertsev online has seen considerable growth, with prominent blockchain developers and users sharing a link to the FreeAlex page. There is also a Change.org petition that has accumulated over 5000 signatures supporting the developer. The arrest has also drawn vocal protests from Edward Snowden and the larger crypto community, while the OFAC sanctions have come under stinging criticism from privacy advocates and crypto users. Keith Cheng, Pertsev’s lawyer, called the hearing a good beginning in educating the court and authorities about the functioning of decentralized finance, stating that a lack of knowledge was the reason why Pertsev was behind bars. He explained, However, Cheng expressed disappointment at the prospect that Pertsev would have to spend more time in jail, stating,",top,287
288,Lowriding was born in California but it's restricted. Lawmakers want to change that,Joe Hernandez,2023-02-16 10:06:40,"A lowrider cruises through the 72nd annual East LA Mexican Independence Day Parade on Sept. 16, 2018, in Los Angeles. Mario Tama/Getty Images hide caption A lowrider cruises through the 72nd annual East LA Mexican Independence Day Parade on Sept. 16, 2018, in Los Angeles. California is the birthplace of lowrider culture. Modifying cars with advanced hydraulics systems and elaborate paint jobs and then taking them on a slow cruise down a main drag is a decades-old tradition. But certain lowrider vehicles are illegal in California, and many cities still have bans on cruising. Some Golden State lawmakers want to change that with a new bill that would end restrictions on lowriders and effectively legalize cruising across the state. ""Our tagline is, 'cruising is not a crime,' "" Assemblymember David Alvarez, who sponsored the legislation, told NPR. The proposal would do two things. First, it would end restrictions on lowrider vehicles in California state law. Right now, owners are barred from modifying their passenger vehicles so that the body of the car is closer to the ground than the bottom of the rims. Second, it would end any limits on cruising on California streets. Cities and towns across California are currently permitted to pass their own cruising bans, which several have done. Jovita Arellano, with the United Lowrider Coalition, said at a press conference that she's been cruising since she was a young girl and supports lifting the limits on the pastime. ""The passion for cruising has never left my heart. It's a part of who we are. And unfortunately, right now, on the books, it's being criminalized,"" Arellano said. ""We can't do that. We can't criminalize our culture."" Cruising and lowriders both have their roots in postwar Southern California, where Chicanos made an art form out of car customization and turned to driving as a means of socializing and community organizing. But among outsiders, lowriding developed a reputation for clogging traffic and having links to gang activity. In the late 1950s, California enacted a state law regulating lowriders. And in the late 1980s, the state began permitting cities and towns to put in place cruising bans over fears of traffic congestion and crime, lawmakers said. Lowriders have long argued that the ordinances designed to curb cruising unfairly targeted Latinos. Last year both houses of the California Legislature unanimously approved a resolution urging towns and cities across the state to drop their bans on cruising, but it didn't force any municipalities to do so. A number of California cities have recently scrapped their bans on cruising, from Sacramento to San Jose . And in several cities where cruising is outlawed in certain areas, such as National City and Modesto , there are efforts underway to repeal the decades-old rules. But bans remain on the books in places such as Los Angeles, Fresno and Santa Ana. Alvarez said the bill has broad support and he expects it to become law, which would help undo stereotypes about cruising and lowriding and allow people to enjoy the custom legally. ""The reality is that people who are spending their time and their money — and these cars can be very expensive — they're not individuals who are looking to do any harm,"" Alvarez said. ""Acknowledging that this activity is part of our culture and not trying to erase that from our culture is important, especially when it's a positive activity,"" he added.",top,288
289,The earthquake in Turkey and Syria offers lessons and reminders for disaster response,Jaclyn Diaz,2023-02-16 10:01:10,"Members of a search and rescue operation work Sunday on an area that collapsed during the earthquake in Antakya, in southeastern Turkey. Disaster recovery experts say ordinary people are crucial to saving lives. Bernat Armangue/AP hide caption Members of a search and rescue operation work Sunday on an area that collapsed during the earthquake in Antakya, in southeastern Turkey. Disaster recovery experts say ordinary people are crucial to saving lives. In the immediate aftermath of a devastating earthquake, where someone is trapped in their collapsed home or office building and waiting for help, it's likely that the first people to help won't be trained professionals. ""The people who are going to have the most effect on the rescue is going to be your neighbors. Because they're the ones right there, right when it happens,"" Forrest Lanning told NPR. He's an earthquake and volcano response liaison with the Federal Emergency Management Agency and a structural engineer. Lanning and other emergency and disaster response experts say that no matter the area around the world hit by an earthquake or other kind of emergency, people should know that effective help often comes from the immediate community. It's one of many lessons experts take from studying disasters like the 7.8 magnitude earthquake that decimated large areas in Turkey and Syria . Spreading that awareness, and training people to respond when official rescuers aren't able to do so, are among the measures emergency response experts say are essential to saving the most lives in the immediate aftermath of a disaster. ""Events like this are, of course, absolutely devastating, but they remind us of the importance of scientific research and putting that research into practice through building codes and retrofitting [infrastructure], enforcing policy and things like sharing knowledge to establish best practices,"" Lindsay Davis, the earthquake disaster assistance team manager at the U.S. Geological Survey, told NPR. Rescue workers continue to clear rubble from collapsed houses in Sarmada, Syria, on the border crossing with Turkey, on Sunday. Hussein Malla/AP hide caption Rescue workers continue to clear rubble from collapsed houses in Sarmada, Syria, on the border crossing with Turkey, on Sunday. Experts say the growing death tolls — more than 39,000 in Turkey and Syria — reflect how important search and rescue efforts are within the first 12 hours to two days. The window of opportunity to save people trapped under collapsed buildings ""will start to close pretty fast and by the time you get around day four or five, it's done,"" Lanning said. Even if a bystander can't pull someone out of the rubble, they can still pinpoint for responders areas where people were located, said Natalie Simpson, the professor and chair of operations management and strategy at the University at Buffalo School of Management. Response efforts will be prioritized in locations where bystanders have already found people alive, she said. ""It takes a long time at each building, to have to listen and carefully remove pieces of the building debris to get to people,"" Lanning said. And with the scene in Turkey ""there's thousands and thousands of these buildings,"" he added. This is made even more important by the fact that international teams take 24 to 48 hours to arrive, Lanning said. Generally, there are nowhere nearly enough local search and rescue teams on the ground to respond to each collapsed building. This was the case in Samandağ in Turkey where civilians were digging through rubble in an attempt to save family and friends following the earthquake. After several hours, a small group of rescuers arrived and they were stretched thin, The Guardian reported. Knowing the importance of quick, local aid, the Community Emergency Response Team was developed in the U.S. It's a FEMA program that trains volunteers across all 50 states with basic disaster response skills. It teaches people what to do after a major earthquake, where to get water after an emergency, how to check on immobile neighbors, and how to search collapsed buildings, Lanning said. There are factors, like types of injuries and how many search and rescue teams are on the scene, that contribute to how likely a trapped person is to survive. He noted that if a trapped individual is uninjured or has minor injuries, they can last up to a week under a collapsed building. And miracles do happen. Reuters reported Tuesday that seven survivors were rescued from the rubble in Turkey more than a week after the initial earthquake. Simpson with the University at Buffalo said she wishes each time disaster strikes there would be an immediate mobilization of rescue crews and military. That's not always the case, and it wasn't in Turkey and Syria, she said. The Turkish government has come under criticism for its response. President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has admitted ""the first day we had some discomforts,"" but had insisted by the second and third days ""the situation got under control."" Huseyin Seferoglu, 23, is pulled from the rubble of a collapsed building in Antakya, Turkey, on Sunday. Petros Giannakouris/AP hide caption Huseyin Seferoglu, 23, is pulled from the rubble of a collapsed building in Antakya, Turkey, on Sunday. ""The single, biggest failure point in emergency response is failure to pick up on the fact that this is an emergency,"" Simpson said. The instinct is to wait to get more information. ""With emergencies, all of them, including the aftermath of an earthquake, you're not in Kansas anymore,"" she said. ""These are not normal conditions and so one of the traps that we fall into is, 'Oh God, what's the best thing to do at this moment?' Stop it with 'best.' It's all good. Let's get moving."" In many areas around the world, including Turkey, the military is best equipped to operate in a disaster-transformed landscape and to open airstrips to get aid in quickly, she said. But the Turkish government failed to immediately mobilize its military to aid in the direct rescue efforts or to establish those all-important field hospitals and airstrips, according to an analysis published by the Middle East Institute, a nonprofit think tank. Turkey is an earthquake-prone region and will always be susceptible to massive devastation, Simpson said. ""There's a very important lesson here: It's never too early to activate your large-scale response when you're not getting any information out of a region,"" she said. ""I think that that will make an impression on decision-makers elsewhere, that will actually help people in the future."" Simpson said this is also a reminder to: ""Activate your military, immediately. The sooner that you get going on that, the better off you'll be."" People stand by a collapsed building in Kahramanmaras, in southern Turkey, on Sunday. Emrah Gurel/AP hide caption People stand by a collapsed building in Kahramanmaras, in southern Turkey, on Sunday. ""While search and rescue operations are critical, research is very clear that mitigation and prevention are the most effective when it comes to minimizing disaster losses,"" Davis with the U.S. Geological Survey said. What is lost when the work isn't done to cut risks to homes and civilians in earthquake-prone regions has been made clear in Turkey. Lanning said this latest disaster hammers home how important it is for global communities in earthquake-prone areas to strengthen infrastructure to withstand a disaster like the one in Turkey and Syria. Major earthquakes that struck Turkey in 1999 and 2011 served as two important lessons to officials that the country's building construction needed to be retrofitted to combat future disasters. ""A lot of the damage there is because of the type of construction and type of buildings,"" which is mostly concrete, said Lanning, who has worked for 15 years in various earthquake-prone areas of the world. This is despite the knowledge that concrete buildings are not the best at withstanding earthquakes. They are very easy to construct and can easily hide imperfections, he said. Much of the work to analyze this latest disaster and what went wrong or right will come in the following months and years. But it's incredibly valuable work, Lanning said. ""Having earthquakes makes us more prepared. It makes us better prepared and more resilient,"" he said.",top,289
290,An owl that escaped from the Central Park Zoo is still loose — and hunting on his own,Kaitlyn Radde,2023-02-16 10:01:10,"A Eurasian eagle-owl named Flaco sits in a tree in Central Park in New York City on Feb. 6. It escaped after its enclosure at the Central Park Zoo was vandalized, and it's now hunting for itself. Seth Wenig/AP hide caption A Eurasian eagle-owl named Flaco sits in a tree in Central Park in New York City on Feb. 6. It escaped after its enclosure at the Central Park Zoo was vandalized, and it's now hunting for itself. Flaco, the owl that escaped the Central Park Zoo in New York City nearly two weeks ago, is still on the loose. But zoo officials now say a big concern has been alleviated: Flaco is hunting for himself. The zoo had been worried that the Eurasian eagle owl wouldn't be able to find its own food because he's used to captivity. The owl escaped on Feb. 2 after someone cut the stainless steel mesh on his exhibit. The zoo called it ""a deliberate criminal act which jeopardizes the safety of the bird"" and said it's under investigation by the New York Police Department. No suspects have yet been identified. Zoo officials have been watching the bird closely since his escape, as he spends his days in Central Park. Watchers ""have seen a rapid improvement in his flight skills and ability to confidently maneuver around the park,"" the zoo said on Sunday . The zoo said officials are no longer concerned about his ability to hunt and eat. Scott Weidensaul , an author who researches owls, says he's ""really not surprised that Flaco's been able to get in touch with his ancient Eurasian eagle owl ancestors and start doing what owls have been doing for millions and millions of years,"" even though he might not be as good of a hunter as a wild owl. Eurasian eagle owls mostly eat small mammals, and Flaco has been known to favor rats . But they would take opportunities to eat other kinds of prey, like birds, Weidensaul tells NPR. While Eurasian eagle owls can go weeks without food in some circumstances, bird metabolisms are high, and the hunger pangs by day four or five likely served as a good incentive for Flaco to figure out hunting. The zoo has tried to recapture Flaco by luring him to familiar food — dead rats — which hasn't worked so far. ""Birds are delicate animals"" with hollow bones and easily broken feathers, Weidensaul says. ""They're also significantly armed"" with huge and powerful talons, so chasing Flaco around with nets could harm both the bird and the humans involved, the researcher adds. The zoo said Flaco ""seems to be comfortable in the area of the park where he has been hunting, and we don't want to do anything to encourage him to leave this site,"" but he still faces potential challenges. One of the main risks Flaco faces is rat poisoning, since he's been eating rats in an urban environment, Weidensaul says. Rat poison is ""certainly capable of killing a bird,"" he says, ""but even at sublethal levels, there are health problems."" Because rat poisons are anticoagulants, owls that eat them may bleed from cuts that would otherwise heal. Flaco could also fly out of the park at any time, ""and there's a world of traffic out there,"" Weidensaul says. Getting the owl back into captivity isn't just good for his safety. It's also good for the ecosystem of Central Park. ""I'd hate to have"" a large, non-native owl ""occupying space in Central Park where native owl species might conceivably, eventually be able to establish themselves,"" Weidensaul says. The zoo will continue to monitor Flaco, though not as intensively. Birders have been watching the owl since his escape, and the zoo says it's confident it'll be able to track his movements. ""We thank everyone who is pulling for the eagle owl's safe recovery and understand the importance of good birding etiquette while observing and photographing him,"" the zoo said. The NYPD's 19th Precinct tweeted on Feb. 2 that police had found the owl on the sidewalk on 5th Avenue soon after his escape, but ""he had enough of his growing audience & flew off"" into Central Park, where he's been since.",top,290

This time it's Democrats accusing Republicans of wanting to maim the very popular federal health program that covers 64 million seniors and people with disabilities. In the past, Republicans have successfully pinned Democrats as the threat to Medicare. Why do politicians persistently wield Medicare, as well as Social Security, as weapons? Because history shows that works at the ballot box. Generally, the party accused of menacing the sacrosanct entitlements pays a price — although it's the millions of beneficiaries relying on feuding lawmakers to keep the programs funded who stand to lose the most. Republicans have repeatedly warned they would hold raising the federal debt ceiling hostage unless Democrats negotiated changes to Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. The three programs together, along with funding for the Affordable Care Act and Children's Health Insurance Program, account for nearly half of the federal budget . The political bomb that went off during President Joe Biden's State of the Union speech had been ticking for weeks. In his speech, Biden threatened to veto any Republican efforts to cut Social Security or Medicare. It was one of only three veto threats he made that night. During a trip to Florida after the speech, he said it more forcefully: ""I know a lot of Republicans, their dream is to cut Social Security and Medicare. Well, let me say this: If that's your dream, I'm your nightmare."" Senior Republicans have distanced themselves from the proposals Biden was referencing, notably ideas from the House Republican Study Committee and Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., to make cuts or even let Medicare expire unless Congress votes to keep it going. ""That's not the Republican plan; that's the Rick Scott plan,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said on a Kentucky radio show Feb. 9, echoing his opposition to the plan last year. ""Cuts to Social Security and Medicare are off the table,"" House Speaker Kevin McCarthy declared the day before Biden's veto threat. McConnell and McCarthy know something that Rick Scott apparently does not: Politicians threaten big, popular entitlement programs at their peril. And, usually, it's been Republicans who suffer the electoral consequences. This dates at least to 1982 , when Democrats used threats of Republican cuts to Social Security to pick up more than two dozen House seats in President Ronald Reagan's first midterm elections. In 1996, President Bill Clinton won reelection in part by convincing voters that Republicans led by House Speaker Newt Gingrich wanted to privatize Medicare and Social Security. At the beginning of his second term, in 2005, President George W. Bush made it his top priority to ""partially privatize"" Social Security . That proved singularly unpopular. In the following midterm elections, Democrats won back the House for the first time since losing it in 1994. In 2010, Republicans turned the tables, using what they described as ""Medicare cuts"" in the Affordable Care Act to sweep back to power in the House. (Those ""cuts"" were mostly reductions in payments to providers; beneficiaries actually got extra benefits through the ACA.) The use of the Medicare cudgel likely reached its zenith in 2012, when Democrats took aim at Medicare privatization proposals offered by Paul Ryan, the House Budget Committee chair and Republican vice presidential candidate. That debate produced a controversial political ad , paid for by the progressive Agenda Project Action Fund and recalled by many in Washington, that showed a suited man in a red tie – presumably, Ryan – dumping a wheelchair-bound ""granny"" off a cliff as the words flashed, ""Is America Beautiful without Medicare?"" The reality is that Medicare's value as a political weapon also sabotages any effort to come together in a bipartisan way to solve the program's financing problems. The last two times the Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust Fund was this close to insolvency — in the early 1980s and late 1990s — Congress passed bipartisan bills to keep the program afloat. Even the word ""cut"" can be political. One stakeholder's Medicare ""cut"" is another's benefit. Reducing payments to medical providers (or, more often, reducing the size of payment increases to doctors and hospitals) may reduce premiums for beneficiaries, whose payments are based on total costs of the Medicare program.. Meanwhile, raising premium s or cost sharing for beneficiaries is a benefit to all taxpayers, who help fund Medicare. Increasing available benefits helps doctors, hospitals and other health providers, as well as beneficiaries, but costs more for taxpayers. And on, and on. There are fundamental differences between the parties that can't be papered over. Many Republicans want Medicare to shift from a ""defined benefit"" program — in which beneficiaries are guaranteed a certain set of services and the government pays whatever they cost — to a ""defined contribution"" program, in which beneficiaries would get a certain amount of money to finance as much as they can — and would be on the hook for the rest of their medical expenses. This would shift the risk of health inflation from the government to seniors. And while it clearly would benefit the taxpayer, it would disadvantage both providers and the people on Medicare. But there are many, many intermediate steps Congress could take to at least delay insolvency for both Medicare and Social Security. Some are more controversial than others (raising the payroll tax that funds Medicare, for example), but none are beyond the steps previous Congresses have taken every time the programs have neared insolvency. Republicans are correct about this: Medicare and Social Security can't be ""fixed"" until both sides lay down their weapons and start talking. But every time a politician unsheathes their talking points about ""Medicare cuts,"" that truce seems less and less possible.",top,291

293,Cosmos Hub To Initiate Rho Network Upgrade Today,Amara Khatri,2023-02-16 09:30:00,"The upgrade will be the last major upgrade before the eagerly anticipated Replicated Security release. The Cosmos Hub, the main chain of the Cosmos ecosystem, is all set for the Rho network upgrade, scheduled for mainnet launch on Thursday, the 16th of February, 2023. The upgrade will be executed at block height 14099412 and is the last major upgrade on the network before the release of the highly anticipated Replicated Security. The upgrade will begin laying the groundwork for the upcoming Interchain Security system, set to be released in the first quarter of 2023. However, the Hub team has cautioned users that they could face some downtime during the execution of the upgrade. The road to Rho has been a long one. Over the course of its development, the future set for Rho had seen continuous change. The Rho upgrade was initially intended to ship with Cosmos SDK v0.46, along with improvements in Groups and Governance. However, thanks to several contributing factors, it was decided that the upgrade would ship with the Cosmos SDK 0.45 release line. Furthermore, a number of features from the Cosmos SDK v0.46 release line will show up in future Cosmos Hub releases. The current Rho upgrade consists of several minor improvements, along with an extensive update to testing infrastructure. It also includes the addition of a new Global Fee module, which TGrade has developed. This Global Fee software module will enable the collection of transaction fees from users around the globe. According to a statement by Cosmos, the aim of the upgrade is to improve the overall security of the Cosmos Network by reducing the likelihood of validators colluding with each other or misbehaving. The successful implementation of the Rho upgrade will clear the path for Replicated Security, which will see the addition of a host of consumer chains into the Cosmos ecosystem. Users looking for more information and wishing to get up to speed with the upgrade process can do so through the Cosmos GitHub page. The consists of over 200 blockchains where developers can build and deploy application-specific chains. The Cosmos Network relies on several core technologies and frameworks, such as Tendermint Consensus and the Cosmos Software Development Kit. Through these technologies and frameworks, it is able to create individual chains such as Kava, Injective, Osmosis, Thorchain, Evmos, and Canto. Furthermore, the chains are connected with one another through the Cosmos Hub and the Inter Blockchain Communication (IBC) communication protocol. As mentioned earlier, the Rho upgrade creates the groundwork for the Interchain Security update, which is slated for release during the first quarter of 2023. The update will enable individual chains in the Cosmos ecosystem to secure themselves using the same security validators that help run the , which acts as a hub for other blockchain networks in the ecosystem and enables interoperability and cross-chain communication.",top,293
294,Smaller Mercedes G-Class ICE And EV Coming In 2026: Report,I,2023-02-16 09:17:57,"The year was 2012 when Mercedes unveiled this futuristic-looking Ener-G-Force concept and rhetorically asked whether the G-Class would still be around in 2025. It most certainly will, with a purely electric EQG to boot. As a matter of fact, the family could grow to include another member if we were to rely on a new report published by this week by the German business paper Handelsblatt . Apparently, the three-pointed star wants to launch a baby G. CEO Ola Källenius is believed to be the driving force behind a smaller G-Class that could be out as early as 2026. It allegedly won't go by the name of GLG, nor will it be mechanically related to its bigger brother. Instead of using the same body-on-frame platform, the downsized G is believed to ride on Mercedes' new MMA architecture debuting in 2024. The underpinnings will be used for the next-generation CLA / CLA Shooting Brake, GLA, and GLB. That would make the more compact G-Class a unibody crossover, similar to the relationship between the Ford Bronco and Bronco Sport . Consequently, it wouldn't be able to match the off-road chops of the legendary Geländewagen. The same source mentions the new G flavor wouldn't be that much smaller lengthwise but would have a significantly lowered ride height, so less ground clearance along with worse approach and departure angles. In an interview with Motor1.com in April 2022, Christoph Starzynski, Mercedes-Benz vice president of development for electric drive said MMA will be an EV-first platform but not EV-exclusive. He went on to mention compromises will be made on the ICE side . The petite G is believed to come with both combustion engines and electric drivetrains. MMA is being engineered to support 800V for fast charging, better batteries, and a new MB.OS software for cars that will be at least 4.5 meters (177 inches) long. These vehicles will be part of Mercedes' ""Entry Luxury"" class and will use the lessons learned in aerodynamics during the development of the Vision EQXX concept . However, we're not expecting the smaller G-Class to have a sleek body since logic tells us it'll be boxy like the real G. The Future Of G Looks Bright:",top,294

People say that Larry made up stories about how he was a high-flying government agent. In the recently released series, Yalitza, Felicia, and many other young girls go through scary things. They slowly come to terms with what happened to them, and some of them have even made up with their parents after Ray managed to change their minds about them.

297,Forbes Takes Down Article “Why SEC Treats Ripple & Ethereum Differently”,Okoya David,2023-02-16 08:20:36,"Forbes Takes Down Article That Critiques SEC’s Treatment of Ripple. Unsurprisingly, it has sparked outrage within the XRP community. Forbes has unexplainably taken down an article by Senior Forbes Contributor on Tech Policy, Dr. Roslyn Layton, which critiques the perceived unfair treatment of blockchain payments firm Ripple by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. The article titled “Why The SEC Treats Ripple And Ethereum Differently” is now blocked by a pop-up of an editor note that reads, “This page is no longer active.” However, thanks to screenshots shared by members of the XRP community who disclosed that the article is still viewable in reader mode on selected browsers, The Crypto Basic was able to peruse its content. In the article, Dr. Layton raises questions about why the SEC gives Ethereum a free pass through the controversial 2018 Bill Hinman speech, which the regulator claims to be sufficient guidance for the emerging industry but chooses to treat Ripple and XRP differently. The policy researcher who describes this as a potential “inconsistency” in regulations expresses that the rub could lie in the hotly contested Hinman documents. The Hinman documents refer to emails and other materials related to the drafting of the controversial speech. Notably, at one point, the speech became the focus of the SEC case against Ripple, with the agency initially resisting Ripple’s efforts to access the documents. While the SEC finally handed over the documents to Ripple last October after previously resisting six court orders to do so, the agency is now seeking to keep the documents sealed per Omnibus motions filed last December. It again argued that these deliberations are subject to attorney-client privilege, adding that leaving them open to public scrutiny could negatively impact the ability of agency officials to deliberate policy in the future. Notably, Dr. Layton, in her article, expressed the view that the SEC’s argument is a tough sell considering that it says it serves as guidance for the nascent market. She argues that these documents could clarify if the free pass given to Ethereum were motivated by Hinman’s alleged conflict of interest or if there is confusion among regulators that could justify confusion among industry participants and Ripple’s fair notice defense. Consequently, as reported today, she has filed a motion requesting that the court unseal the documents. Unsurprisingly, XRP community members have expressed outrage that Forbes appears to have taken down the article. Attorney John Deaton, whose firm had quoted the article reporting the Forbes contributor’s filing, expressed shock, writing, “Wth.” Meanwhile, Forbes has previously taken down an article by the Tech Policy contributor. However, it is worth noting that the author wanted to edit the piece in the previous instance. At press time, Dr. Layton and Forbes are yet to respond to requests for comment. However, The Crypto Basic will update this report if it gets feedback.",top,297
298,Challenges for Neobanks USA,Sandy,2023-02-16 08:19:11,"One of the primary factors of Neobanking Business Models, especially Neobanks based in the USA, is to offer fully online and digitized banking services, unlike traditional and legacy banks which operate brick-and-mortar banking services. As a result, Neobanking Business Models face some challenges and drawbacks that fintech start-ups wishing to enter the industry must be aware of when planning how their Neobank will operate. The Neobanking market is also becoming more crowded as the new wave of banking is seen as a more attractive and profitable option, and so some of these challenges may be resolved as the industry continues to grow. The following are some of the challenges that the community face. The Neobank market is plagued with high transaction costs and limited subscriptions because of the lack of physical locations. To maintain a sense of legitimacy, traditional banks must charge exorbitant transaction fees and offer a limited number of free services in order not to lose customers. In contrast, Neobanks must offer affordable subscription plans at a reasonable or lower cost in order not to lose customers. This can be achieved through an efficient use of technology, an innovative pricing policy, or increased interest in particular Neobank payment solutions. Neobanks must offer affordable subscription plans at a reasonable or lower cost in order not to lose customers. This can be achieved through an efficient use of technology, an innovative pricing policy, or increased interest in particular Neobank payment solutions. Another issue related to the Neobank business model is the profitability issue that is associated with the sector. The Neobanks have an extremely high operating costs, and as a result, they need to make a significant amount of money in order to maintain their operations. This is also coupled with the fact that the sector is heavily regulated, which means that it would be difficult for Neobanks to increase their profitability levels. Another issue of the Neobanking business model is that the regulation surrounding the operation continues to change and develop as does the industry, and as a result regulation is constantly evolving to undermine Neobanks differentiators, in a bid by regulators to protect traditional banking services. The issue for Neobanks is that with the constant change of regulation, they cannot create a consistent long-term plan for the future, which undermines their ability to be a long-term competitor for traditional banks. This creates a risk for Neobanks since they cannot plan ahead, and as the industry changes, they are at the whims of those changes. Neobanks also face the challenge of convincing people to switch from traditional, legacy banking systems to the newer, Neobanking business model. Neobanks have a difficult time convincing people that a financial institution is worth switching from its current system. Many of the traditional banks offer things that Neobanks cannot provide such as physical locations or personal relationships with employees. Additionally, Neobanks aren’t able to provide many of the same services that most traditional banks offer such as deposits and lending.",top,298

Dorsey rejected the request by the U.S. Department of Justice’s bankruptcy watchdog, which argued that an independent examination must be launched to investigate allegations of “fraud, dishonesty, incompetence, misconduct, and mismanagement.” The DOJ further argued that the allegations are “too important to be left to an internal investigation.” Judge Dorsey, however, rejected the request saying that such a proposed investigation would be redundant to other investigations currently carried out by FTX’s new management team and law enforcement. Dorsey also relied on the experience of FTX’s newly appointed CEO, John Ray’s experience in dealing with companies “in dire need of financial condition.” He also explained that a new investigation would be an unnecessary spend of FTX’s limited funds: Adding, The Judge further reasoned: FTX and the panel representing its junior creditors relied on much of the same arguments of Judge Dorsey.

301,Why Was Roseanne Barr Not In The Conners?,Rahul Gupta,2023-02-16 08:00:11,"Do you know why Roseanne Barr didn’t make it to The Conners? No one knew what happened to the actress because she didn’t show up in the second season of Roseanne. Did she fight with anyone in the cast? John Goodman talked about how much they “miss” her on set. Her absence is pretty clear. Also, Roseanne doesn’t like how her character was written out of the show. Before we go any further, let’s talk briefly about how well-known Roseanne Barr is in the business. Roseanne Barr is a versatile actress, but she is best known as a stand-up comedian. She won both an Emmy and a Golden Globe for her work on Roseanne. Roseanne was born in Salt Lake City, Utah, on November 3, 1952. She is now 70 years old. Master of the Good Name, The Office, The Millers, My Name Is Earl, and Cristela are all shows that Roseanne Barr has been in. Roseanne is also a host, which is important to remember.

In 1994, she was the first woman to ever host the When Roseanne Barr was asked why she wasn’t on The Conners, she said it was “witch burning.” As was already said, it wasn’t her choice to leave. Then? Reason Behind Roseanne Barr Not Being In The Conners Revealed Roseanne Barr was not on The Conners because she had sent out racist tweets in the past. These things are also pretty mean. What happened? To be more specific, she wrote that post about Valerie Jarrett. She was an African-American woman who was Barack Obama’s top advisor during his presidency, in case you were wondering. Valerie was also thought to be one of the most important people who worked for the former president. Roseanne Barr wrote on this note, “ .” This was a very hard thing to do. Roseanne even apologized for this, saying that the post was political and that she did not have racism in mind when she made it. What, though? It was too late, and he didn’t say sorry. ABC, which airs The Conners, then decided to keep the show going without Roseanne. At first, it didn’t seem like an easy choice, but it turned out to be the only one. Channing Dungey, the president of the ABC network, has confirmed that Roseanne will not be on the show. He said, “Roseanne’s tweet is disgusting, questionable, and goes against our values.” Read More: We all know that The Conners is part of Roseanne, which came after it.

Data from Etherscan reveals that the SHIB transfer to Coinbase occurred yesterday at 21:09 (UTC). Shortly after this movement, the bankrupt broker sent 10,000 ETH tokens worth $16.9 million to Binance US at 21:46 (UTC). The last transaction involved the transfer of 5,000 ETH ($8.46 million) to Coinbase a few seconds later. Voyager still holds 1.6 trillion SHIB ($23.5M) as press time, the second largest single holding on the wallet. It bears mentioning that Voyager made similar transfers to Binance US and Coinbase the previous day. As highlighted by PeckShield, the embattled crypto lending platform had sent 7,000 ETH to the two American exchanges on Feb. 14, with 6,000 ETH going to Binance US and 1,000 ETH to Coinbase. Recall that Voyager had received a whopping 105,000 ETH from FTX last September, two months before the FTX collapse. Moreover, The Crypto Basic reported three SHIB transactions from Voyager to Kraken, Coinbase, and Binance US earlier this month . The transfers, which triggered concerns of a SHIB dump, involved a cumulative amount of 270B Shiba Inu. There is limited knowledge of the purpose of these transfers, and Voyager has not granted a request for comment as of press time. Voyager’s Deal with Binance US Notwithstanding, Voyager’s connection to Binance US is not a mystery among crypto proponents. The American exchange entered a deal to purchase Voyager’s assets last December after the bankrupt broker’s previous deal with FTX went void in the wake of the FTX implosion. Last month, a US judge gave Voyager the green light to sell its assets to Binance US despite the SEC’s initial objection. As the acquisition deal inches closer, last Thursday’s reports suggested that Binance US and Voyager had engineered a plan to enable Voyager’s customers to withdraw their assets through Binance US accounts. As revealed in a court filing, both entities expect payments to begin in March though customers might not recover all their assets.",top,302

304,LBank Celebrates Lao CBDC Ambitions,Chainwire,2023-02-16 07:40:56,"Road Town, BVI, 16th February, 2023, Chainwire LBank’s CMO has commented on Laos’ efforts to introduce a central bank digital currency (CBDC). According to Kaia Wang, the pilot project is a net positive that could engender tangible benefits for citizens of the Lao People’s Democratic Republic in Southeast Asia. The Bank of the Lao People’s Democratic Republic Payment Systems Department has signed a memorandum of understanding with Tokyo-based blockchain developer Soramitsu to create a proof of concept for a CBDC. The partnership was announced on February 7 and based on the results, the Lao PDR will research further toward an official CBDC. “Everyone should have access to convenient financial services. No one should be excluded, even if they do not have a bank account,” LBank CMO Kaia Wang shared. “Easy and fast payment systems are integral to the functioning of modern society. Whether it’s buying a cup of coffee or sending money to loved ones abroad, it should never be a struggle.” The DLak, a digital form of the Lao kip, is distributed to consumers via commercial banks and could be converted to fiat instantly, allowing payments to be made in real-time. According to an explanatory video by Soramitsu, payments made with digital money prior to the new system typically took one month to get through, as funds would be transferred through multiple banks. With the DLak, consumers can scan a QR code and make payments regardless of whether they have a bank account. The World Bank estimated in 2021 that only 37% of over 15s have a bank account in Lao. Financial inclusivity for people without bank accounts is listed as one of the DLak’s objectives. Additionally, simplifying remittances and reducing remittance costs are among its core goals. The DLak project is based on a previous collaboration between Soramitsu and Cambodia. The Cambodian Bakong system was launched in October 2020 and is not a CBDC. According to an article by Nikkei Asia, Laos will also explore digital cross-border transactions with Cambodia. Another aim of the DLak is to “ensure economic security through a local currency that does not depend on other countries.” Other countries in the region, including Vietnam and the Philippines, are also looking into CBDCs, while countries such as Fiji have shown interest in the concept. “It’s great to see more and more countries showing an interest in blockchain technology and tapping into its potential to make people’s lives easier,” Wang added. “We are seeing more and more mainstream use of blockchain technology, and we can’t wait to see further initiatives.” About LBank LBank is one of the top crypto exchanges, established in 2015. It offers specialized financial derivatives, expert asset management services, and safe crypto trading to its users.

307,The Fight for Justice: Filing a Lawsuit for Camp Lejeune Contamination,Sandy,2023-02-16 07:15:37,"Camp Lejeune, a United States Marine Corps base in North Carolina, has a long and unfortunate history of groundwater contamination. Between the 1950s and 1980s, the base’s drinking water was contaminated with toxic chemicals, including benzene, trichloroethylene (TCE), and perchloroethylene (PCE), causing serious health problems for many of the people who lived and worked there. Health Consequences of the Contamination The Camp Lejeune contamination resulted in serious for many of the individuals who were exposed to contaminated water on the base. Some of the most commonly reported health problems are cancer, birth defects, and other serious medical conditions. For example, a study has found a correlation between exposure to contaminated water and heightened dangers of various cancers, including breast cancer and leukemia. According to the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) study, Marines and Navy personnel who were stationed at Camp Lejeune between 1975 and 1985 had a 10% greater likelihood of succumbing to any form of cancer. Furthermore, the children of individuals who were exposed to the contaminated water at Camp Lejeune are at a higher risk of suffering from birth defects and developmental issues. These health problems can greatly affect their standard of living, leading to considerable medical costs, reduced income, and other forms of loss. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimate that between 8,000 and 10,000 babies born at Camp Lejeune, who were exposed to the contaminated water, have been diagnosed with oral clefts, cleft lip, and neural tube birth defects since the contaminations were uncovered in the 1980s. If you or someone you know has been affected by the contamination, you may be eligible to file a in order to seek compensation for any injuries or losses you have suffered. This article will outline the steps involved in the process of filing a lawsuit in this situation. Step 1: Gather Evidence The first step in filing a Camp Lejeune contamination lawsuit is to gather evidence of your exposure to the contaminated water. This may include medical records, military records, and other documents that show you lived or worked at Camp Lejeune during the period of contamination. You should also collect any information about the health problems you or your loved one experienced, such as diagnosis and treatment records. Step 2: Consult with a Lawyer Next, it is important to consult with an experienced personal injury lawyer who specializes in Camp Lejeune contamination cases. Your lawyer can help you understand your legal rights and options and advise you on the best course of action for your case. Step 3: File a Claim Once you have gathered your evidence and consulted with a lawyer, you may be able to file a claim against the government or other responsible parties. There are different types of claims you can file, including personal injury claims, wrongful death claims, and property damage claims. Your lawyer can help you determine the best type of claim to file based on your specific circumstances. Step 4: Prepare for Trial If your claim cannot be settled out of court, you may need to prepare for trial. This may involve gathering additional evidence, preparing witness testimony, and working with experts to build a strong case. Your lawyer will be your best resource for guidance and support throughout this process. Step 5: Seek Compensation If you are successful in your Camp Lejeune contamination lawsuit, you may be able to recover compensation for your injuries, medical expenses, lost wages, and other damages. This compensation can help you, and your loved ones cope with the physical, financial, and emotional toll of the contamination. Important Considerations When Filing the Lawsuit Statute of Limitations It is important to keep in mind that there is a time limit for filing a Camp Lejeune contamination lawsuit. This is known as the statute of limitations, and it varies depending on the type of claim you are filing and the state in which you live. It is important to consult with your lawyer as soon as possible to ensure that your claim is filed within the statute of limitations. Class Actions In some cases, individuals affected by the Camp Lejeune contamination may be able to file a lawsuit. This type of lawsuit allows a large group of people with similar claims to join together to seek compensation. By filing a class action, individuals can pool their resources and increase their bargaining power against the government or other responsible parties. If you are interested in joining a class action lawsuit, your lawyer can provide you with more information and help you determine if this is the best option for your case. Filing a Camp Lejeune contamination lawsuit can be a complex and challenging process, but it is also an important step in seeking justice and compensation for the harm caused by the contaminated water. If you or a loved one were affected by this tragedy, seek the help of an experienced personal injury lawyer and take the steps necessary to protect your rights and interests.",top,307

It gave them a newfound appreciation for what the human body could accomplish. A freediving couple made history by sharing the longest underwater kiss ever — a four minutes and six seconds — and said that it has given them more respect for what the human body can accomplish.In a luxury resort in Maldives on February 4, Beth Neale from South Africa and Miles Cloutier, a Canadian, broke the previous longest underwater smooch record. The previous record of three minutes 24 seconds was set 13 years ago in Italy, according to the Guinness World Records.The couple met around five years ago in Bermuda, where Neale taught Cloutier how to freedive, which is diving without breathing equipment. They later got engaged and now have an 18-month-old daughter.While together they have traveled the world together and filming freediving videos which they post to a joint Instagram. Breaking the world record was a feat that they first set their eyes on three years ago.""We thought this was something we could do, and it would just be a really just awesome thing for us to do, just because we could do it,"" Cloutier, 33, told Insider.But they pushed back their plan when Neale discovered that she was pregnant with their first child, and they did not want to attempt anything extreme that could harm the baby. But with 18-month-old Neve by their side, the parents decided last Christmas to go ahead with the plans, in time for Valentine's Day.They started training for the challenge in their home pool in South Africa, two weeks before they flew into Lux South Ari Atoll Resort in Maldives.This was where they broke the record. The attempt was in front of Guinness World Records adjudicator Swapnil Dangarikar from India, two official witnesses, timekeepers, and a crowd of resort guests and staff, per a press release shared by the couple.Neale, who is a professional freediver, said that the longest she had gone underwater in one breath was six minutes. But staying underwater while kissing another person is much more complex, she told Insider.""When you're connected to another person, you're not in a relaxed position at the surface. We could feel exactly what's happening to the other person, which impacts your mental state,"" Neale, 40, said.She said that another big challenge that they encountered was the nerves of trying to break the record, which caused their heart rates to increase as they were attempting it.""Your heart rate is meant to decrease if you want to hold your breath for a longer time,"" she said. Both of them, she said, had to fight the intense urge to draw breaths.The experience gave Cloutier a newfound appreciation for his body.""I have even more respect for my body since doing the challenge and breaking the record,"" Cloutier said. ""The body is capable of more than you think, right?""Neale said that she hoped that people seeing them break the record will be inspired to discover the underwater world. ""I hope that this gives them a passport to this incredible world that needs protection and needs all the love. It can get. And, you know, hopefully it will inspire people to discover that for themselves,"" she said.Read the original article on Insider",top,312
313,Bitcoin Is up Nearly 12% Today – Here’s the Only Reason Why,Okoya David,2023-02-16 05:41:30,"Reports of a possible Binance settlement of U.S. probes mingled with positive price action sees the market soaring. At the time of writing, Bitcoin and Ethereum are up 11.56% and 9.10%, respectively, in the last 24 hours, as the crypto markets rally, with the total crypto market cap sitting comfortably above $1 trillion at $1.12 trillion, up 8.62%. As highlighted by Santiment Feed yesterday, Bitcoin has tapped a six-month high, trading above $24.2k for the first time since Aug. 14, 2022. The crypto analytics platform has tapped a slight increase in accumulation by investors holding 100 to 1k BTC as the reason for the latest price surge, urging investors to watch the reaction of big bag holders for additional confidence. Pseudonymous seasoned price action analyst Duo Nine expressed confidence that the bear market is conclusively over. He said this, noting that Bitcoin had formed a new high on the charts. From a short-term price action perspective, the price surge comes as BTC fulfilled a double-bottom reversal pattern formed on the 4-hour price chart, as highlighted in a previous report . The price surged as high as $24.9k before paring gains to trade around the $24,688 price point at the time of writing. Meanwhile, reports indicating that Binance expects to pay fines to end probes from United States regulators have likely boosted this surge. The Wall Street Journal reported this yesterday, citing an interview with Binance Chief Strategy Officer Patrick Hillman. Hillman asserted that the leading crypto exchange initially driven by software engineers lacked knowledge of the laws regarding crimes like money laundering and economic sanctions. Consequently, the Binance executive says the exchange is willing to pay penalties for its past mistakes, asserting that it is working with regulators toward this outcome. An end to these U.S. probes would be a significant win for the company and the broader crypto market. As the largest crypto exchange, fear, uncertainty, and doubt surrounding it often negatively impact the market. Reuters has previously reported that the U.S. Department of Justice kicked off money laundering and criminal sanctions investigations into the exchange as far back as 2018.",top,313

324,What is the Marburg virus? WHO confirms outbreak of the deadly viral disease in Equatorial Guinea,esnodgrass@insider.com (Erin Snodgrass),2023-02-16 03:12:01,"Particles of Marburg virus are shown in false color here.FR/NIH/NIAID/BSIP/Universal Images Group via Getty Image Equatorial Guinea confirmed an outbreak of the deadly Marburg virus this week. The highly contagious virus causes fever, fatigue, and blood-stained vomit. There are no vaccines or antiviral treatments currently approved to treat the virus. The World Health Organization confirmed an outbreak of the deadly Marburg virus in Equatorial Guinea this week.The viral fever is confirmed to have killed at least one person in the country and is linked to another eight deaths, according to the organization. In addition to the nine deaths, there are another 16 suspected cases in the country, with patients exhibiting symptoms that include fever, fatigue, and blood-stained vomit and diarrhea.The virus' presence in the country's eastern Kie Ntem Province marks the first outbreak of the disease in Equatorial Guinea. It comes approximately six months after an outbreak of cases was reported in Ghana in July 2022.Marburg virus is rare among people but it is highly infectious once it finds a human host, and the disease can be fatal, with an average fatality rate of around 50%, according to the WHO. During a 2005 outbreak of the virus in Angola, the death rate among Marburg patients was as high as 88%, the agency said. What are the symptoms of the Marburg virus?Common symptoms of the Marburg virus include hemorrhagic fever, fatigue, blood-stained vomit, and diarrhea. Illness from the disease often begins abruptly, according to the WHO, starting with a high fever, a bad headache, and malaise. Muscle aches and cramps can accompany the onset, as well as jaundice, nausea, and pain in the abdomen. The CDC said a non-itchy rash can also appear around the fifth day of the disease, striking the patient's chest, back, or stomach. Patients can occur ""ghost-like"" around day three, with deep-set eyes, expressionless faces, and extreme lethargy, according to the WHO. In fatal cases, death often occurs between eight and nine days after the onset, usually preceded by blood loss and shock, the agency said. The virus is highly contagious and bodies can remain contagious even after death. What is the treatment for Marburg?There are no known vaccines or antiviral treatments currently approved for the virus, according to the WHO, but supportive care, including rehydration efforts and treatment of specific symptoms, can improve patients' chances of survival. Marburg virus can be difficult to diagnose given its similar presentation to several other infectious diseases, including malaria, typhoid fever, meningitis, and Ebola. The disease originates from the same virus that causes Ebola.The Marburg virus is transmitted to humans via fruit bats, which are a natural host of the virus, according to the WHO.The virus is not respiratory. Once a human is infected, the virus spreads through direct contact with the bodily fluids of infected people, as well as via contaminated surfaces and materials. The virus was first recognized in 1967 among lab workers conducting research in Marburg and Frankfurt, Germany, and in Belgrade, Serbia.How is the WHO responding to Equatorial Guinea's outbreak?The UN health agency said in a Monday statement that it had deployed health emergency experts in epidemiology, case management, and infection prevention to Equatorial Guinea to try and control the outbreak. The organization also sent advance teams to the impacted area to trace contacts, isolate people showing symptoms of the disease, and provide medical care. Authorities in neighboring Cameroon said Wednesday that the country had detected two suspected cases of the disease in a commune that shares a border with Equatorial Guinea. Read the original article on Insider",top,324

326,"At least 20 Jeffrey Epstein victims were paid a total of $1 million through JPMorgan accounts, newly unredacted lawsuit alleges",lloydlee@insider.com (Lloyd Lee,2023-02-16 03:07:20,"Tim Clayton/Corbis via Getty Images The US Virgin Islands accused JPMorgan Chase of complicity in Jeffrey Epstein's trafficking ring. The lawsuit alleged that the financial firm failed to report ""suspicious activity"" even after Epstein's 2008 conviction. Parts of the lawsuit were unsealed Wednesday, detailing the allegations. At least 20 people who were victims of Jeffrey Epstein's trafficking ring were paid through JPMorgan Chase accounts, according to recently unsealed details from the US Virgin Islands' lawsuit against the financial institution.The documents were part of the Virgin Islands government's lawsuit against JPMorgan Chase, originally filed in December, accusing the financial firm of facilitating the now-dead pedophile's sex-trafficking scheme and ignoring red flags that should have halted activity on his accounts.The US Virgin Islands filed a significantly less redacted version of the lawsuit on Wednesday, which includes a fuller accounting of the claims. It alleges Epstein had 55 different accounts with JPMorgan Chase worth ""hundreds of millions of dollars,"" and used funds in those accounts to collectively pay victims more than $1 million between 2003 and 2013.""These women were trafficked and abused during different intervals between at least 2003 and July 2019, when Epstein was arrested and jailed, and these women received payments, typically multiple payments, between 2003 and 2013 in excess of $1 million collectively,"" the court documents stated.Emails cited in the lawsuit suggest even JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon was knowledgeable about Epstein's involvement with the financial institution.""JP Morgan's banking relationship with Epstein was known at the highest levels of the bank,"" the lawsuit says. ""For instance, an August 2008 internal email states, 'I would count Epstein's assets as a probable outflow for '08 ($120mm or so?) as I can't imagine it will stay (pending Dimon review).'""Jes Staley befriended Epstein while he was supposed to look for red flags, the lawsuit saysThe newly unsealed portions of the lawsuit in particular detail interactions between Epstein and Jes Staley, a longtime executive at JP Morgan. He later stepped down as the CEO of Barclays bank after a probe into his relationship with Epstein. Staley visited Epstein's home in the US Virgin Islands and even corresponded with him while he was incarcerated after pleading guilty in 2007 to soliciting sex from a minor.""Between 2008 and 2012, Staley exchanged approximately 1,200 emails with Epstein from his JP Morgan email account,"" the lawsuit says. ""These communications show a close personal relationship and 'profound' friendship between the two men and even suggest that Staley may have been involved in Epstein's sex-trafficking operation.""Epstein emailed Staley multiple pictures of women, which remain redacted from the lawsuit. The two also exchanged emails describing how they had ""fun"" together and reference Disney princess movies like ""Snow White"" and ""Beauty and the Beast.""The bank flagged Epstein as a ""high-risk"" client as early as 2006, following news reports about his arrest on charges that he solicited girls for sex.Despite their closeness, JPMorgan permitted Staley to oversee Epstein's accounts at the bank and even tasked the executive with discussing the human-trafficking allegations against him, the lawsuit says.A January 2011 compliance review concluded there were ""no material updates"" after a 2011 review of Epstein's account, based on what the lawsuit says was Staley vouching for Epstein.""Jes Staley discussed the topic with Jeffrey Epstein who replied there was no truth to the allegations, no evidence and was not expecting any problems. We will continue to monitor the accounts and cash usage closely going forward,"" the note stated, according to the lawsuit.Unsealed portions of the lawsuit appear to show internal emails from JPMorgan employees to outline how the bank knew Epstein was a ""high-risk client"" but continued to provide banking services to the financier.According to the suit, after new allegations of child trafficking emerged against Epstein, a member of JP Morgan's ""risk management division"" asked in a 2010 email: ""Are you still comfortable with this client who is now a registered sex offender.""A spokesperson for JPMorgan Chase did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Earlier this month, the bank asked the judge overseeing the case, in a federal court in Manhattan, to dismiss the lawsuit.Lawyers for JPMorgan said the US Virgin Islands government had access to the same information about Epstein's finances that they did at the time and that it was greedy after already arriving at a $100 million settlement with Epstein's estate.""Having sought and obtained more than $100 million from Jeffrey Epstein's estate and businesses for damages caused by his sex-trafficking crimes, the United States Virgin Islands (USVI) now casts farther afield for deeper pockets,"" lawyers for JPMorgan wrote.Read the original article on Insider",top,326
327,Tom Holland’s Spider-Man Will Return To The MCU: Details,Emily Burr,2023-02-16 03:00:00,"Tom Holland will be returning to the Marvel Cinematic Universe via his iconic portrayal of Spider-Man. Kevin Feige, the president of Marvel Studios, says that the company is already working on how it will facilitate Holland’s comeback. Marvel Studios is keeping the specifics of the story under wraps. However, Feige gave some small details in an interview with Entertainment Weekly. He said, “All I will say is that we have the story. We have big ideas for that, and our writers are just putting pen to paper now.” He did not hint further as to what the future holds for Holland’s Spider-Man. Because Feige stopped short before he could say what the future of Spider-Man will hold in the MCU, we are unsure if this will include a new solo film. It could also mean a new appearance in one of the highly-anticipated upcoming Avengers solo films. Holland’s last performance as Peter Parker took place in the 2021 film Spider-Man: No Way Home. The film was a box office hit. It grossed $1.9 billion on the global scale. Fans raved over and discussed the film, particularly the inclusion of Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield‘s own versions of the character. Tom Holland’s Spider-Man Tom Holland attends Sony Pictures’ “Spider-Man: No Way Home” Los Angeles Premiere on December 13, 2021 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic) Film producer, Amy Pascal (Spider-Man: Homecoming, Spider-Man: Far From Home, Spiderman: No Way Home) teased in late 2021 that the film company was in the process of creating another Spider-Man film trilogy staring Tom Holland as Peter Parker. Pascal told Fandango, “This is not the last movie that we are going to make with Marvel – [this is not] the last Spider-Man movie. We are getting ready to make the next Spider-Man movie with Tom Holland and Marvel. We’re thinking of this as three films, and now we’re going to go onto the next three. This is not the last of our MCU movies.” Marvel Studios is currently working on Avengers: Secret Wars. The release date is set for May 1, 2026. The 12-issue comic book saga that the film is based on ran through the mid-1980s. The lineup of superheroes included Spider-Man, Captain America, Hawkeye, Captain Marvel, Hulk, Iron Man, and more. The top cast for the film, as currently listed on IMDB, includes Kathryn Newton, Jonathan Majors, Dominique Thorne, Iman Vellani, and more. They’ll star alongside Marvel Cinematic Universe veterans, Chris Hemsworth, Benedict Cumberbatch, Mark Ruffalo, Simu Liu, and Anthony Mackie. The film is still in the early stages of pre-production so there is a potential for the cast list to grow. [Via]",top,327

337,I thought I knew how to resist diet culture. Then my boss commented on my clothes and eating habits.,insider@insider.com (Nandini Maharaj),2023-02-16 02:30:00,"The author, left, with her sister. right, visiting their cousins over summer vacation in 2000.Courtesy of Nandini Maharaj I've been fat-shamed for years by family members, classmates, and my now former boss. My boss once asked me where she could buy clothes after she had put on some weight.  Experts suggest having open conversations about boundaries so people know when they've crossed them. The first time I remember gorging myself on food was at my dad's funeral. A friend of his had brought over pastries with pink frosting. I wasn't hungry. But I kept eating them, one after the other, hoping no one would notice. Everyone was probably too consumed by grief to say anything. Or maybe it was because I was skinny, and seeing me indulge myself in this sugary bliss was the least of their worries.Then, as puberty struck, the fat deposits started winding their way to my chest. I didn't understand why I needed to hide my breasts until an unenlightened adult told me, ""Pull up your shirt, for God's sake."" I was 10 years old. It was midsummer, and I was wearing a powder-blue tank top with ruching at the neckline.""We need to get her a bra,"" my uncle said aloud as my aunt and cousins piled into the car.I looked down at my chest, confused since I was wearing an A-cup bra and wondering why God or my uncle would concern themselves with my boobs. The answer came to me in 10th grade when my sister's close guy friend called me ""fat"" repeatedly. I was a size 4, not a 0, so I could understand his contempt for my body.Other times, high-school boys were a bit more creative with their insults, saying, ""Hey, Oprah, Oprah,"" as I stepped out of the girls' locker room. Normally, a comparison to the visionary talk-show host would be flattering, but I figured they weren't likening me to her because she's a media mogul. ""It means they think you're fat,"" my friend told me when the boys were out of earshot.Her explanation, though lacking tact, would prove a shrewd observation some 15 years later when I started a new job. My now former boss approached me and said, ""I've been meaning to ask, where do you shop for clothes?"" Before I could answer, she went on to tell me she had put on weight after not exercising for months. ""Nothing fits me anymore besides sweatpants, so I thought you could suggest some places to shop,"" she said.One time, she spotted me eating spaghetti at my desk and told me she didn't eat ""such heavy dishes"" at lunch. Over the next few weeks, she continued with remarks about her rapid weight gain in between asking me personal questions about my age, family life, and what I ate for dinner. Being in my 30s, I thought I would know how to put a stop to the behavior, reminiscent of the taunts I endured in high school and the embarrassment I had felt in my powder-blue tank top. When I worked as a therapist, I coached women on how to respond to someone commenting on their appearance.But I couldn't say anything. I responded the same way as I did as a child and teenager: smiling, brushing it aside, and accepting someone else's assessment of my physical flaws. What is fat-shaming?What I've described above are examples of ""fat-shaming,"" when ""we single out others based on their body weight, type, or size,"" Daryl Appleton, a New York City therapist and Fortune 500 executive coach, told Insider. In everyday situations, fat-shaming can look like commenting on a person's weight, bullying or disrespecting them, or discriminating against them based on their body type.Sometimes people don't come right out and call you fat. Instead, they appeal to sentiments about mindful eating and workplace wellness when you don't fit into their mold of a healthy and thriving workforce. They label foods as ""good"" or ""bad"" along with the people who consume them. In other words, they subscribe to ""diet culture,"" ""a societal construct that highlights eating and exercising to achieve an ideal physical shape, which allows for more praise and acceptance,"" Appleton said, adding: ""This is not to be confused with nutrition and intentional movement, which promotes exercise and sustenance as a way to live healthier."" In my boss' case, she had already made up her mind about me based on my appearance. She saw what I was eating for lunch a whopping total of one time in the eight weeks we worked together and made it her mission to project her insecurities onto me.Is it ever acceptable to talk about body types at work?""Work is supposed to be a place of productivity, so unless your physical body weight has something to do with your ability to get your job done, it should be a nonfactor,"" Appleton said.To be fair, my former boss might have been concerned about the added stress on an aging elevator system or the potential for extra wear and tear on the carpet as I lumbered back and forth between my desk and the copy room. I wasn't hauling equipment or modeling swimwear. But seriously, even while I tried to empathize with her insecurities, I realized it was unfair of her to pile onto mine.Appleton said there's always a risk when trying to hold a toxic person accountable for their behavior, especially when they're in a position of power. If you draw a line at them discussing your appearance, they could fire you or make your time at work miserable. But whatever you decide to do, no one should ""punish you for having healthy conversations about boundaries, and if they do, that may tell you everything you need to know about the person, job, and workplace culture,"" she added.  What can you say to someone who is fat-shaming you?Sometimes people aren't aware that conversations about weight are ""not appropriate or well received,"" Appleton said, so learning that they've crossed a line might be new information for them. If their remarks are making you uncomfortable, you can try saying, ""While I appreciate the attempt to try to look out for my health and wellness, this conversation is not landing for me in a way that is helpful,"" she said. In other situations, you might need to be a bit more direct with the person by requesting a change in their behavior. Depending on your relationship with the person and how comfortable you feel, putting an immediate stop to the behavior might be necessary.If the thought of confronting someone makes you sick to your stomach, you're not alone. While I didn't feel safe standing up to my boss, I finally managed to tell my uncle that I didn't want to talk about my weight or eating habits. It might not seem like much, but the girl in the powder-blue tank top would tell you otherwise. Read the original article on Insider",top,337

The duo has previously collaborated on two colorways of the Nike Air Humara in 2022. The shoe was included as part of their 15-piece Summer 2022 collection. Now, Jacquemus and Nike will once again design a new sneaker that will surely sell out among both brands’ fan bases. The Jacquemus brand teased minor details of the shoe via social media yesterday. Revealed thus far are white leather uppers, a mesh tongue, and “JF1” branding on the metallic lace lock. Swoosh-branded leather aglets are also shown. Although there is a minimalistic spin on the classic white Air Force 1, similar elevated materials may or not be used as the Air Humara. These materials include ballistic mesh, premium leather, and buttery suede. Other textiles that can be used to create the sneaker include organic cotton, hemp, and recycled polyester, as befitting to the Jacquemus brand. The Jacquemus X Nike Air Force 1 Jacquemus x Nike Air Force 1 pic.twitter.com/8Nm7p8734E— Modern Notoriety (@ModernNotoriety) February 10, 2023 The simplistic aesthetic of the shoe allows room for experimentation when styling. It has not been disclosed whether or not the shoe will be released in both men’s and women’s sizes. For those who are thinking about copping regardless, the shoe is perfectly made for both menswear, and womenswear looks. The shoe is primarily white, so a bright contrasting color scheme would go flawlessly with the “JF1”. This announcement comes after the release date of Nike’s high-profile luxury Air Force 1 collaboration with Tiffany & Co. The shoe is set to arrive on March 7th. This collaboration did not sit well with fans of the beloved shoe and left many dissatisfied. In terms of price point, the Jacquemus X Nike Air Humara retailed for $170. It is possible that the shoe can be around or right at that number. Although we do not have a release date for the sneaker yet, we can assume that the shoe will be a part of a Spring/Summer collection. The shoe may also be presented during an upcoming fashion week showcase. The question is, what is next for the duo? Perhaps a line of accessories and clothing adorned with signature Jacquemus touches a Nike swoosh to seal the deal.

If you can find a haven of comfort in being seen, that’s helpful. If you can watch a film and be inspired to work out, great. Inspired to love somebody better, great. Inspired to be a better best friend, great. That’s the business I’m in.” Advertisement Related marvel cinematic universe ant man Jonathan Majors Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania Ellen Barkin Recalls Being 'Ripped Apart Physically' Early In Her Career Alison Brie's Extreme Valentine Move Actually Worked On An Old Boyfriend Alec Baldwin To Resume Filming 'Rust' After Manslaughter Charges Go To Homepage Before You Go Ben Blanchet Suggest a correction Popular in the Community You May Like",entertainment,348
349,"Pontiac May Have Planned A ""Knight Rider"" Edition Trans Am For 1983",I,2023-02-16 03:34:05,"For many kids, Knight Rider was the first show we programmed on our VCRs. It lasted four seasons and spawned several made-for-TV movies. There was also official show merchandise, but surprisingly no official tie-in with Pontiac. That's why when the Knight Rider Historians uncovered evidence of an official ""Knight Rider"" special edition Pontiac Trans Am, we took notice. Joe Huth and AJ Palmgren are the lone crusaders who champion this cause in a dangerous world. The world of the Knight Rider . According to their YouTube channel, no official agreement existed between Pontiac and the show. Additionally, while the first season referenced KITT as a ""black Trans Am,"" subsequent seasons made vague references to him as a ""black t-top"" or ""black sports car,"" specifically avoiding any references to Pontiac or the Trans Am. However, once the show became popular, Pontiac may have planned a limited ""Knight Rider"" edition Trans Am. For evidence, Huth and Palmgren reference a three-page article in the June 1983 High-Performance Pontiac, which revealed that Pontiac was testing a black 1983 Trans Am with the Daytona 500 Pace Car aero package. In addition to the black paint, the car featured red accents and ""Knight Rider"" stenciled in red tape. The trail goes cold after that magazine article until the early 2000s. That's when photos of the car surfaced from another fan, Adam Urbanski. He discovered them while cleaning out a file cabinet at a tier 2 automotive plastics supplier and says they were part of a professional photo shoot. Then in 2006, he tracked down one of the cars for sale on eBay. In addition to info on the ""Knight Rider"" edition Trans Am, the Knight Rider Historians tracked down the original GMC semi that was part of the Flag Mobile Unit . They also located other cars used to promote the show and were recently featured on our Rambling About Cars podcast . More Knight News: If Knight Rider taught us anything, it's that ""One man can make a difference."" Or, in this case, two men. We don't know if the Pontiac ""Knight Rider"" edition Trans Am is still out there. But if it exists at all, finding it is a shadowy flight into a dangerous world of a car that does not exist.",entertainment,349

In an interview on <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY8XcmrIujE"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">DC</a>, Gunn shared that Viola Davis will still be playing her <a href=""https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/the-suicide-squad-which-original-cast-members-return-in-the-sequel.html/""><em>Suicide Squad </em>character Amanda Waller</a>. But actors like Henry Cavill and Gal Gadot, for instance, are not returning as Superman and Wonder Woman respectively. Still, so far the fate of many DCEU actors seems to be up in the air, including Calle’s.</p> <figure class=""wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter""><div class=""wp-block-embed__wrapper""> <blockquote class=""twitter-tweet"" data-width=""550"" data-dnt=""true""><p lang=""en"" dir=""ltr"">He's not meeting the major characters for the first time, either.

The spread of COVID-19 was still a significant issue during filming, so producers got a charter plane for both seasons to ensure the safety of their cast and crew.</p> <p>Instead of racing through airports to book the fastest ticket to their next destination, all teams traveled together between legs. Gone were the days of airport drama and delayed flights. While the show can survive without airports, it’s less exciting. And it doesn’t help that the show’s other changes also dulled its content.</p> <p>Teams would mainly drive themselves to different tasks and pit stops rather than hail a taxi or catch a train. Plus, there were fewer tasks and twists because producers wanted to reduce filming time. So, in <em>The Amazing Race</em> Seasons 33 and 34, there were no (aired) Speed Bumps or U-Turns. As a result, both seasons disappointed some fans.</p> <figure class=""wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio""><div class=""wp-block-embed__wrapper""> <div class=""jetpack-video-wrapper""><iframe loading=""lazy"" title=""The Amazing Race 34: Luis and Michelle Finalist Interview"" width=""925"" height=""520"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/UON_s5_tSq4?feature=oembed"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"" allowfullscreen></iframe></div> </div></figure> <h2>Fans express their problems with ‘The Amazing Race’ following season 34</h2> <p>While awaiting <a href=""https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/the-amazing-race-will-season-35-premiere-fans-speculate-date.html/""><em>The Amazing Race</em> Season 35</a> news, one fan started a <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/TheAmazingRace/comments/10xpcye/frustrated_with_the_last_two_seasons_rant/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Reddit</a> thread to air out their negative feelings toward the show. They wrote, “I can say that seasons 33 and 34 have been the worst for me. I understand season 33. The fact that it started filming in 2020 and all the complications that happened to delay the race from being completed for 19 months is understandable. So I gave it a pass. I understood that it fell into its own limbo in essence.”</p> <p>“However [season 34], just turned out to be again the same feeling,” they continued. “A watered-down version of what I grew to love after binging 32 seasons of it over the last 3.5 months.”</p> <p>The Reddit user went on to list their problems with <em>The Amazing Race</em> Season 34: “No airport. No U-Turns. Watered down challenges. No Speed Bumps. [Less than] or [greater than] 12-hour Pit Stops. [The lack of] leg money.”</p> <p>They concluded, “I understand that [season 34] was probably filmed sometime in spring/summer of 2022, and things are still iffy with [COVID]. But it just again seems like a watered-down version of the show … Most of the elements of [<em>The Amazing Race</em>] that created all that drama and holes for the contestants to dig themselves out of is gone out of this season. [Season 34] really has just been a letdown for me.”</p> <p>Most <em>The Amazing Race</em> fans agreed with this Reddit user’s self-described rant. One person commented, “It’s just a different show, more focused on cute little tasks than racing. No exotic locales or any real culture shock. I used to love them having to find their own flights and generally figure stuff out. They don’t do that stuff anymore.”</p> <p>Another Reddit user pointed out, “[Host] Phil [Keoghan] has said they will return to the previous format when they are able to, and a lot of these changes are just temporary.”</p> <p>Hopefully, for the sake of <em>The Amazing Race</em> fans, they are right. Once governments lift COVID restrictions, perhaps the series will return to normal. But we think the show’s issues run deeper than that.</p> <figure class=""wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter""><div class=""wp-block-embed__wrapper""> <blockquote class=""twitter-tweet"" data-width=""550"" data-dnt=""true""><p lang=""en"" dir=""ltr"">What an adventure!<img src=""https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2708.png"" alt=""✈"" class=""wp-smiley"" style=""height: 1em; max-height: 1em;"" />?

358,Colin Farrell gets distracted by candy bar during Oscar Luncheon interview,OTRC,2023-02-16 01:36:34,"LOS ANGELES -- In the middle of his Oscar Luncheon interview, alongside his ""The Banshees of Inisherin"" co-star Brendan Gleeson, Colin Farrell tried to discreetly slip a Twix candy bar into his jacket pocket. The action did not go unnoticed and George Pennacchio joked, ""Thank goodness you took a piece of candy!"" Farrell explained, ""The Twix was being coy. Its label was faced the other way, staring at me the whole interview."" He then asked Gleeson if he wanted a Snickers. Gleeson declined, but like a true friend, noted that ""there's two bars in a Twix, so that's one each."" The friends were doing interviews together poolside at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Beverly Hills after the 2023 Oscars Nominees Luncheon. Farrell is nominated for Best Actor in a Leading Role and Gleeson for Best Actor in a Supporting Role. On Gleeson, Farrell told On the Red Carpet, ""there is very little manufactured on my part from working with him."" Their friendship off-screen is very different from that of their characters. In the film, two lifelong friends find themselves at an impasse when one abruptly ends their relationship, with alarming consequences for both of them. It's about heartbreak, destruction and shocking consequences. All the characters have their struggles and secrets. Both Farrell and Gleeson are first-time Oscar nominees and reflected on the gratitude. Gleeson said, ""This particular time between the nominations and whatever happens is such a glorious time."" Both have strong competitors in their respective award categories with Farrell referring to them as ""just the loveliest bunch of fellas."" The cast includes Colin Farrell, Brendan Gleeson, Kerry Condon, Barry Keoghan and directed by Martin McDonagh, who are all Oscar nominees. The film has a total of nine nominations. ""The Banshees of Inisherin,"" from Searchlight Pictures, is streaming now on Hulu.",entertainment,358

364,Allow Marc Maron to regale you with tales of his “ridiculous” Avatar audition,Matt Schimkowitz,2023-02-16 00:14:00,"Alright, what the fuckers, what the fuck buddies, what the fuck-atars. Appearing on stage at the 92nd Street Y in New York City, host joined ’s Josh Horowitz to talk , and we don’t mean Lydia. Marc Maron, a guy who admittedly didn’t “even remember the first” and doesn’t seem to care about the colonization of Pandora, auditioned for James Cameron’s and lived to tell the tale. But before he could even ask Cameron who his guys were, Maron had to wrestle with a “ridiculous” audition that led him to wonder, “Why the fuck would I want that job?” “There’s this assumption that we’re going to do four movies. Dude, I don’t even remember the first one!” Maron said. Reading the script didn’t help because Maron didn’t “know what this all means to the world.” Maron recalls going down to Cameron’s Long Beach studio, where “there’s people doing acrobatics, there’s people flying. It’s like Cirque du Soleil down there.” “So you go in, and [Cameron] gives you the script, and he’s like, ‘Uh, can I have your, you know, you can’t take a picture of [the script]. This doesn’t leave the building, this script.’ I’m, like, ‘Okay, man.’” Maron continues, “[Cameron’s] like, ‘Go take a look, uh, look it over because, you know, you’re here. You might as well just read for this today.’ I’m, like, “Okay, man.” To be a fly on the wall in that Long Beach compound, “the only cool part” of which, to Maron’s mind, is “a museum of James Cameron,” a room that houses the Titanic model and “some other stuff from the other movies.” As Horowitz put it, Maron’s a “big fan.” Things didn’t get any less weird when the cameras were rolling. “All of a sudden, you’re in this zone with these people that he just has around down there to read parts and fly and be on dollies,” he said. “I’m on camera, I think. I got a picture of whatever the fuck it is, a boat or whatever. I’m in the middle of this thing, and I’m totally untethered, and I have no sense of character. I don’t know really what’s happening around me other than there are several unidentified actor people and acrobats all around me.” As we all know, Maron didn’t get the part. Instead, it went to Jemaine Clement from , which was fine by Maron. “Thank god,” the comedian said. “Here’s the fucked up thing about me and acting: I don’t like being away from home. It’s not my bag. I got anxious being there for a week. What am I going to eat?” “My agent was like, ‘You’re probably going to go to New Zealand for four years,’ or whatever the fuck it was. Some ridiculous amount of time. I was like, it’s not happening, and I have no problem with it. I had nothing invested in it other than the experience of, like, all right; I’ll go take the meeting. Then [Cameron] sent me a box of cigars because he didn’t cast me. Okay, that’s nice. At this age, I have no problem saying no.” “Like I would’ve had to go to New Zealand for a year, and people would’ve been like, ‘Were you even in it?’” Maron replied. “But Jemaine lives in New Zealand! He has family there. It was a no-brainer.” As hard as it is to believe, it doesn’t sound like Jake Sully will be stopping by the garage any time soon. (via )",entertainment,364

More than 250 of Disney's crown jewels are on display to celebrate a century of Walt Disney's spirit and storytelling. ""Everything is based on what Walt Disney himself did,"" said Becky Cline, the director of the Walt Disney Archives. ""So, we decided to have Walt host the exhibit."" The exhibit features objects and artifacts from Disney's collection, from costumes from blockbuster films to props like the spell book from ""Hocus Pocus."" ""The magic is everywhere, the sounds, the sights,"" says Tim Tan from Edison, New Jersey. Tan is a member of the D23 Fan Club. They were invited for the exclusive preview. There are artifacts from Walt's vault and items straight from the theme parks, like the ride vehicle from Peter Pan's flight and a Matterhorn Bobsled. Bob Gurr designed it, along with the very first Monorail. ""I'm getting to live it all over again in very great detail across this entire exhibit,"" Gurr said. Each gallery is dedicated to Walt's spirit and his beloved stories. ""Storytelling is really the secret sauce of Disney,"" said Don Hahn, a legendary producer at Walt Disney Studios.

""The exhibit is amazing, so inspiring,"" said 12-year-old Emma Holstein from Langhorne, Pennsylvania. ""It's so incredible."" Tickets for the exhibition are on sale now. ""We've already even sold tickets to people in Thailand,"" said Larry Dubinski, President & CEO of The Franklin Institute. ""We're expecting people coming from everywhere to see this exhibition.""

And while Majors actually has a of big performances on the way (including the upcoming and well- received festival feature ), the obvious sign of his ascension is his role as Marvel’s new marquee bad guy in this week’s —a part that almost didn’t happen, after Majors walked out of his very first meeting with Marvel several years ago. This is per a new interview the actor , in which he revealed that he actually initially walked out of his first meeting with the company when he was fresh out of drama school. I hope this doesn’t bite me in the ass, but I walked out of my Marvel general [meeting]. This was a long time ago. I had just gotten out of drama school and I’m running around town and I’m sitting in the office. I grew up in a very particular way and I don’t want to waste nobody’s time. So I got in there and they’re just busy. And I was like, “I’m supposed to be here, right?” It got long and I went, “ I’m just going to go. It’s cool. I’ll just go. ” And I got to the door, but then they said [casting director] Sarah Finn was going to come. We got in the room and we chatted. We were having this great conversation. I think it was three years later that we had the Kang chat. Now, though, Majors says he has no reservations about his role in the Marvel machine (which expected to extend through several films, as Kang becomes a primary antagonist for the studio’s upcoming movies), saying that, “There’s no trepidation now, especially because of who Kang is. When I said yes, we got the whole picture, and what is being laid out is cohesive.” That being said, he did note some ongoing discomfort with the ways his sudden stardom may end up impacting his life (and heaped some praise on co-star Michael B. Jordan in the process ) : “I don’t bother nobody. I’m not interested in the fuckery of the industry… Michael is such a good example of a movie star because movie stars have to appeal to the bourgeois and the proletariat. Movie stars can show a film in Montana. Movie stars are dangerous to politicians. It’s a different type of burden.”",entertainment,372

As such, fans of the American Rally Association (ARA) are accustomed to seeing number 43 on rally cars with Block and Gelsomino's names on the windows. While we sadly won't see 43, the Block/Gelsomino team lives on. Ken's wife Lucy will race in the 2023 ARA season with Gelsomino as her co-driver. Taking to Instagram, Lucy admitted that ""for a split second"" she thought about selling everything and being done, but that didn't last long. She's an experienced racer in her own right, having competed last year in select ARA events with Ken and their daughter Lia . Per her post, a plan was already in the works for 2023, and she will be pressing on. An announcement from Dirtfish confirms that Gelsomino will join Lucy in the ARA for 2023 as co-driver, but that's not the only Block/Gelsomino team coming this year. Lia Block, who made her ARA debut last year will race a Subaru BRZ in the 2WD category this year. Her co-driver is Alex Gelsomino's wife Rhianon, a veteran of the rally scene who's raced with Travis Pastrana. Lucy and Lia will begin their season at the second round of the 2023 Green APU ARA Championship , the Rally in the 100 Acre Wood taking place March 17-18 in Missouri. It was the location of Ken Block's first rally win back in 2006, and it's also the first rally in which all three competed, just last year. Round one of the season was the SnoDrift in Atlanta, Michigan, which wrapped up on February 11. Rally was such an important part of Ken’s life and this fondness for the sport has spread throughout the whole Block family, so I’m pleased we will run this event. ""We’re very pleased to confirm Lucy and Lia Block will enter next month’s 100 Acre Wood Rally,"" said team manager and Block family friend Derek Dauncey, according to Dirtfish. ""As everyone knows Ken won this event seven times – it’s an event which holds a very special place for all of us. Rally was such an important part of Ken’s life and this fondness for the sport has spread throughout the whole Block family, so I’m pleased we will run this event. We also plan to enter the remaining ARA rounds and look forward to meeting everyone who makes the sport work on each rally.""

380,Eddie Murphy 90s Movies Ranked From Bowfinger to Vampire in Brooklyn,Jeff Ames,2023-02-15 23:00:00,"Following our previous Eddie Murphy list that sorted his 80s-era run, we thought it’d be fun to do the same with the actor’s next batch of films. Best Eddie Murphy 80s Movies Ranked From 48 Hrs. to Trading Places Everyone loves Eddie Murphy. His foul-mouthed shenanigans have delighted audiences since he first stormed onto Saturday Night Live in a… Movies Jeff Ames 3 weeks ago The 1990s were much more of a mixed bag for Murphy, who hit rock bottom with misfires like Vampire in Brooklyn and Another 48 Hrs. before bouncing back with family comedies such as Mulan and Dr. Dolittle. While his star never shined quite as bright as it did early in his carer, Murphy still managed to piece together an impressive resume heading into the 2000s. Check out our list of Eddie Murphy 90s movies ranked from worst to best. 12. Vampire in Brooklyn (1995) There’s so much talent behind Vampire in Brooklyn — Murphy, director Wes Craven, and Angela Bassett, to name a few — that it’s downright perplexing how bland the final product was. Here is an aimless film that can’t decide which direction it wants to take its subject matter. Is it a comedy? A romance? A horror film? I’m not quite sure and that’s a lot of the problem. 11. Another 48 Hrs. (1990) If the original 48 Hrs. ushered Murphy to fame and fortune, Another 48 Hrs. (released nearly a decade later) marks the beginning of his downward spiral. I can forgive Harlem Nights, a minor artistic speedbump in which Murphy at least swung for the fences and tried something wholly unique. Another 48 Hrs., on the other hand, is little more than a desperate cash grab utterly devoid of artistic merit. Gone is the magic that made Jack (Nick Nolte) and Reggie (Murphy) such a lovable dynamic duo, replaced by an assortment of clunky action scenes that are neither thrilling nor intense. Murphy mugs his way through a bland script, while Nolte looks like he’s just waiting for his paycheck. An incredibly disappointing follow-up to a classic film. 10. Holy Man (1998) Holy Man has plenty going for it — chiefly, a great cast and a fun concept that at least made for some good trailers — but never organizes its elements into a satisfying whole. Murphy does what he can with the material, and it’s always fun to see 90s-era Jeff Goldblum, but this is a one-note comedy without a rudder that quickly gets stranded in its desperate bid to attain laughs. 9. The Distinguished Gentleman (1992) Murphy tackles politics in Jonathan Lynn’s good-natured but lackadaisical comedy about a con man who weasels his way into congress and learns about the corrupt nature of the American government. Murphy works his magic in a few scenes, but the sluggish pace bogs down what should have been a raucous comedy. Still, I may need to give this one another look. 8. Beverly Hills Cop III (1994) Am I wrong for kinda liking Beverly Hills Cop III? Yes, it’s lazy and nowhere near as fun or stylish as its predecessors. Still, during a recent rewatch, I found myself … having fun with the threequel that posits Axel Foley in an amusement park to catch the men who killed his boss. Murphy fits the role like a glove and curiously goes for a straighter approach on this go-round with mixed results. No matter, Judge Reinhold is on hand to provide some fun comedy, while Bronson Pinchot returns for a brief bit as Serge. A few action set pieces are well executed, including a sequence set atop a ride where Axel must save a couple of kids. Where else will you see George Lucas appear as a “Disappointed Man?”  I can’t recommend Beverly Hills Cop III as anything more than a guilty pleasure. Everyone, including director John Landis, should have tried harder to make this work. Still, after all these years, the threequel delivers passable entertainment. 7. The Nutty Professor (1996) After a series of critical and box office flops, Murphy struck back in 1996 with The Nutty Professor with mostly positive results. On the plus side, the picture gives Murphy multiple roles to flex his acting chops — he portrays no less than seven characters, who all interact believably — and engage in silly, often hilarious slapstick. On the negative side, the picture doesn’t know when to stop and leans too hard on excessive crudity for a family pic. The Nutty Professor is directed by Tom Shadyac, who never saw a bathroom gag he didn’t like. As he did with Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, Liar Liar, Patch Adams, Bruce Almighty, and I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry, Shadyac points the camera and lets his star(s) do the heavy lifting. Except, for every great moment in Professor, there is a handful of overly sexual, raunchy material that falls flat on its face. Still, the costume and makeup design are incredible, and the splashy special effects are convincing. Unfortunately, Murphy can’t elevate the picture to another gear, resulting in an enjoyable comedy that doesn’t reach the highs of his best work. 6. Boomerang (1992) Murphy toned down the edgy comedy that made him a star for Boomerang. This fun little rom-com lacks the big laughs of Murphy’s best efforts but deserves high marks for introducing a few wrinkles into the tried and true formula. Murphy plays Marcus Graham, a successful advertising executive with a reputation as a womanizer who has the tables turned on him by his vivacious boss Jacqueline (Robin Givens). She also plays the field, you see? And when she ditches Marcus after a brief fling, he flocks to the lovely Angela (Halle Berry) and learns the true meaning of love. Yeah, it’s all relatively lightweight, but the ever-charismatic Murphy and a strong supporting cast — Eartha Kitt, David Alan Grier, Martin Lawrence, Grace Jones, Chris Rock — are enough to make Boomerang a minor gem in the genre. 5. Life (1999) Life is surprisingly touching, even deftly told, about two friends serving a lifetime in prison together. Eddie Murphy and Martin Lawrence play Ray and Claude, a pair of bootleggers who end up in the slammer after a racist cop frames them for murder in 1932 Mississippi. Locked away for life with no hope of parole, Ray and Claude pass the time by bonding with other inmates (including an up-and-coming ballplayer and a gay man), plotting escapes, harboring hope of freedom, and spending countless days bickering with one another. Murphy and Lawrence display remarkable chemistry even as their characters get weighed down by heaps of old-age prosthetics. Their relationship is fun to watch, even as it slowly deteriorates throughout the decades.  Still, something is missing here, and I’ve never been able to put my finger on it. I like Life a lot. There are plenty of laughs — the baby daddy scene always gets me — a strong supporting cast, a satisfying conclusion, and enough depth to draw comparisons to The Shawshank Redemption. Still, it’s merely a good comedy, not a great one. I imagine that’s because the film steers clear of the underlying realities facing the characters. So here we have prison life as seen through a Hollywood lens, full of humor and warmth but lacking the grime and grit of reality. 4. Dr. Dolittle (1998) Dr. Dolittle may not have aged as well as some of Murphy’s more distinguished projects, but Betty Thomas’ PG-13-rated remake of the beloved family musical still produces enough laughs to hold the attention of younger viewers — primarily thanks to a slew of foul-mouthed animals voiced by Norm Macdonald, Albert Brooks, Chris Rock, John Leguizamo, Ellen DeGeneres, and Gilbert Gottfried (among others), who often run away with the show. Still, Murphy holds his own as the titular good doctor, a role he plays surprisingly straight. His job is to react to and ground the nonsense around him, and the megastar brings warmth and gravitas to the endless assortment of fart jokes and low-brow humor. Dr. Dolittle delights as a crude but amiable family comedy. 3. Metro (1997) When Murphy gives a damn, the man delivers. Metro follows the atypical 90s action formula but kicks so much ass that it doesn’t matter that we’ve seen this all before in better films. Owing more to the gritty style of 48 Hrs., Metro positions Murphy as a tough-talking hostage negotiator battling Guy of Gisborne in San Francisco. The cat-and-mouse escapades result in the obligatory chase sequences, shootouts, and standoffs, expertly staged by director Thomas Carter. Still, the picture slows down long enough to let Murphy build a unique character worth rooting for, resulting in one of the actor’s most rewarding action vehicles.   Murphy is so good that it makes one wish Hollywood would’ve unleashed this side of the talented actor more often. Also, kudos to whoever decided to cast the always-incredible Michael Rapaport. Metro is high-octane fun, the type of movie you enjoy with a large bowl of popcorn on a Saturday evening. 2. Bowfinger (1999) Bowfinger ended Murphy’s turbulent 90s run on a high note. While the Frank Oz comedy never achieves the same level of success as the actor’s best films — in other words, it’s really good but not quite Beverly Hills Cop — Bowfinger at least affords Murphy a solid vehicle to showcase his vast talents. Co-starring Steve Martin, Bowfinger follows aspiring filmmaker Bobby Bowfinger (Martin) and his endeavors to craft a sci-fi horror film starring A-lister Kit Ramsey (Murphy), the most popular star on the planet. The only problem is Kit doesn’t know he’s in the movie. Using clever guerilla tactics and a dimwitted lookalike named Jiff (also Murphy), Bowfinger sets out to produce his picture alongside a merry band of misfits, resulting in a smartly written (but mostly goofy) love letter to Hollywood. (Think Tim Burton’s Ed Wood, albeit with less camp.) Martin (who also wrote) and Murphy work beautifully together; their comedic sensibilities mesh well and produce some big laughs. Director Oz is savvy enough to know when a joke has overstayed its welcome and expertly toes the line between satire and farce. Bowfinger is delectable old-fashioned Hollywood entertainment, even if it comes up just short of greatness. 1. Mulan (1998) Before lending his voice to Donkey in Shrek, Murphy tapped into the Disney well and scored a hit as Mushu, the wise-cracking red dragon who aids Mulan on her quest to stop the Huns. As Robin Williams accomplished in Aladdin, Murphy gives Mulan an edge that raises it beyond atypical, animated fluff. It helps that Mulan is a well-written, exciting adventure about a young woman who takes her father’s place in the Imperial Chinese Army, bursting with great songs and a terrific Jerry Goldsmith score. Murphy’s whip-smart edgy humor is merely the proverbial icing on the cake. A genuine Disney classic, Mulan ranks as one of the best animated films ever produced.

As it turns out, the movie is set to start filming rather soon. “It’s going well,” Feige declared. “Our director Yann [Demange] is down in Atlanta right now. Cameras roll in, like, the next 10 weeks or so.” Blade‘s production had a turbulent period late last year, with director Bassim Tariq leaving the project in September.

393,"Raquel Welch, Actress And Hollywood Sex Symbol, Dead At 82",I,2023-02-15 21:53:57,"Raquel Welch, who rose to fame as a sex symbol in the 1960s, has died. She was 82. Welch's son, Damon, confirmed she died Wednesday at her home in Los Angeles after a brief illness. ""She passed away with no pain,"" he said. ""I'm very proud about what she contributed to society and her career and everything. I'm most proud of her doing the U.S.O tours with Bob Hope during the late 60s and early 70s. We missed Christmas with her for three years while she was doing that. She said that was the hardest thing."" Welch's career started in the 1960s with appearances on TV shows such as The Virginian , McHale's Navy and Bewitched . That paved the way for back-to-back roles in Fantastic Voyage , and One Million Years B.C . That latter role catapulted her to sex symbol status. Welch would go on to star in several films, including 1970's Myra Breckinridge, where she played a trans actress, and The Three Musketeers , which earned her a Golden Globe in 1974 for best actress in a motion picture comedy or musical. She leaves behind her two children, her son Damon Welch and her daughter, Tahnee Welch. Welch was born Jo-Raquel Tejada in Chicago, Illinois to a Bolivian father and an American mother. Though she didn't often discuss her identity in the early years of her career, the actress embraced her Latinidad in the early 2000s, both by speaking openly about her background and by playing Latina roles like Aunt Dora in the PBS show American Family and Hortensia in the film Tortilla Soup. ""Raquel Welch was a screen legend during a time when Latinos rarely were given any work in Hollywood (unless it was a stereotype),"" said film critic and Entertainment Weekly editor Yolanda Machado. ""She had to hide her identity to succeed, and despite what a heavy weight that may have been to conceal, she triumphed in memorable performances that stand as a portal into an entire generation."" Welch told the New York Times in 2002 that though she didn't try to intentionally cover up her Bolivian heritage, it wasn't a significant part of her culture at home because of her father's attempts to assimilate as much as possible. ""Those people who wanted to make it in the American system found it necessary and desirable to kind of suppress their Latino quality,"" she explained. ""He never spoke any Spanish in the home, so as not to have us have an accent. We never were in a neighborhood where there were other Latinos around. I didn't know any Latin people."" Welch went on to say that though she partially resented his erasure of their background, she understood he was trying to protect the family from facing prejudice and discrimination. But 40 years into her career, as Latinos made more strides for inclusivity in Hollywood, so did Welch. ""Latinos are here to stay,"" she said at a National Press Club Luncheon in 2002. ""As citizen Raquel, I'm proud to be Latina."" Political cartoonist and TV writer Lalo Alcaraz said that though Welch's background might have come as a surprise to many, he's honored Latinos can say she belongs to the community. ""We don't have that many stars,"" Alcaraz said. ""Raquel Welch is viewed as one of our stars, and I'm happy and proud about that."" Copyright 2023 NPR.

Steve Granitz via Getty Images/Frazer Harrison via Getty Images Tom Brady ’s getting an offensive penalty on this one. The football legend made a pretty ignorant comment about Janet Jackson ’s infamous 2004 Super Bowl wardrobe malfunction that severely affected her career. On an episode of Brady’s “ Let’s Go !” podcast Tuesday, the retired quarterback admitted that football players are usually too focused on the game to check out halftime shows. Brady, who was playing for the New England Patriots during the 2004 Super Bowl, admitted he had no idea Justin Timberlake ripped off part of Jackson’s corset and exposed her breast during the halftime show until after the game was over. Advertisement “[The media was] asking me about that. I couldn’t even understand what they were telling me about,” Brady said in a conversation that begins about 28 minutes into the episode. “They said, ‘Did you see the halftime show?’ and I said, ‘I didn’t see anything.’ I was thinking about the game.” And this is when Brady fumbles his take on the situation, which was dubbed “Nipplegate” at the time. “I think in the end, it was probably a good thing for the NFL because everyone got to talk about it, and it was just more publicity and more publicity for halftime shows,” Brady said. “Is any publicity bad publicity? That’s what they say, so, who knows?” Advertisement Super Bowl 2004’s broadcaster CBS, halftime show producer MTV and Jackson issued apologies for the wardrobe malfunction. Jackson’s spokesperson at the time explained that Timberlake was meant to “pull away the bustier and leave the red-lace bra” and that the exposure of most of her breast was “not intentional,” per CNN . Federal Communications Commission Chairman Michael Powell also noted to CNN at the time that he did not believe the incident was accidental. “Clearly somebody had knowledge of it. Clearly it was something that was planned by someone,” he said. “She probably got what she was looking for.” Jackson’s career took a hit after the incident, with the media vilifying her despite the malfunction being an error on Timberlake’s part. In her 2022 Lifetime documentary, Jackson indicated that she’d rather forget the incident ever happened, and that Timberlake offered to “speak up,” per Variety . Advertisement “We talked once and Justin said, ‘I don’t know if I should speak up and make a statement.’ And then I was like, ‘Look, I don’t want any drama for you. If I were you, I wouldn’t say anything,’” Jackson said. “Justin and I are very good friends and we always will be. We talked a few days ago. He and I have moved on and it’s time for everyone to do the same.” Related Super Bowl Tom Brady janet jackson Patrick Mahomes And Jalen Hurts Reportedly Didn't Shake Hands On Field After Super Bowl Reporter Reveals What Jason Kelce Said To His Brother After Super Bowl Defeat Tom Brady Shares A Curious Quote About Love For Valentine's Day Related Super Bowl Tom Brady janet jackson Gus Kenworthy Says A Gay Kiss In '80 For Brady' Was Cut 'For Middle America' All-Women Team Of Pilots Make History In Super Bowl Flyover Marjorie Taylor Greene Makes Absolutely Baffling 9/11 Claim In Bonkers New Video Go To Homepage Before You Go Elyse Wanshel Reporter, HuffPost Suggest a correction Popular in the Community You May Like",entertainment,396

398,Rihanna Famously Declined Headlining The Super Bowl Halftime Show In Protest. Then Motherhood Changed Her Mind.,Anthony Robledo,2023-02-15 21:23:55,"Rihanna Rihanna Famously Declined Headlining The Super Bowl Halftime Show In Protest. Then Motherhood Changed Her Mind. “You’re geeked on a challenge like that because you know what your body just did. You feel this sense of ‘Nothing is impossible.’” By by Anthony Robledo BuzzFeed News Reporter Posted 4 hours ago Twitter Facebook Link Inez & Vinoodh / Via vogue.co.uk See the full feature in the March issue of British Vogue available via digital download and on newsstands from Tuesday 21st February. Rihanna didn’t take on headlining the Super Bowl halftime show lightly. For years, the singer declined the major event, in part because of the NFL’s treatment of Colin Kaepernick , the football star who knelt during “The Star-Spangled Banner” at the start of multiple games in 2016 in protest against racial injustice and police brutality that sparked a larger movement. “I just couldn’t be a sellout. I couldn’t be an enabler,” Rihanna told Vogue in 2019 . “There’s things within that organization that I do not agree with at all, and I was not about to go and be of service to them in any way.” However, her opinion on headlining changed, as evidenced by her performance on Sunday that brought in the second-most viewers ever for a halftime show . Rihanna outlined her reasons for deciding to finally headline on Wednesday in a cover story for British Vogue . It turns out much of her justification has to do with last year’s headliners: Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Mary J. Blige, Eminem, 50 Cent, and Kendrick Lamar . “Representing the urban community, globally. It is powerful. It sends a really strong message,” Rihanna told British Vogue. “Two Super Bowls back-to-back.” Inez & Vinoodh / Via vogue.co.uk That’s not to say she doesn’t still have her issues with the NFL. “There’s still a lot of mending to be done in my eyes,” Rihanna said. “But it’s powerful to break those doors, and have representation at such a high, high level and a consistent level.” Another major motivator was Rihanna’s 9-month-old son , whose name she and A$AP Rocky have not shared publicly. Becoming a mother last year made her realize that “nothing is impossible.” “It’s this knowing that you can do anything,” she told the magazine. “Even things that seem the craziest, like, ‘I’m going to say yes to the Super Bowl in the middle of postpartum?’” But that wasn’t the biggest surprise. Rihanna eventually learned that she’d be headlining while pregnant with her second child. As anyone who watched the Super Bowl knows by now, Rihanna unveiled a baby bump during the big show. Representatives for the singer later confirmed that she is pregnant. Icon Sportswire / Icon Sportswire via Getty Images Rihanna performs at halftime during Super Bowl LVII between the Philadelphia Eagles and the Kansas City Chiefs on Feb. 12 at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona. She told British Vogue that she did not know she would be carrying another child when she agreed to take the stage, let alone taking the stage for the first time in seven years. “Seven years! From zero to Super Bowl? That’s mental,” Rihanna said. “What the heck am I thinking? But you’re geeked on a challenge like that because you know what your body just did.” The last motivator to take on the high-stakes show was her fans, who are barely surviving the Rihanna music drought . She wanted to put on a show for people who missed her music. With a list of infinite hits impossible to fit into 13 minutes, Rihanna said she opted out of costume changes to instead focus on giving her fans what they really wanted: to hear her sing. She managed to pack 12 songs into the show. The singing won’t stop, if Rihanna can help it. Of course, the singer also told the magazine about her long (long) awaited follow-up album to 2016’s Anti . She’s thinking it’ll drop this year. “Like, honestly, it’d be ridiculous if it’s not this year,” she said. “But I just want to have fun. I just want to make music and make videos.” More on this Rihanna Unveiled A Baby Bump During Her Super Bowl Halftime Performance Amber Jamieson · Feb. 13, 2023 I'm Only A Casual Rihanna Fan But Her Super Bowl Performance Was Excellent Izzy Ampil · Feb. 13, 2023 ASL Interpreter Justina Miles Almost Stole The Show From Rihanna During Her Halftime Performance Kelsey Weekman · Feb. 13, 2023 We Spoke To The TikToker Who Predicted Rihanna Would Open The Halftime Show With “Bitch Better Have My Money” Kelsey Weekman · Feb. 13, 2023 Ethan Hawke Hilariously Asked For His Son’s Forgiveness For Stealing His Shot With Rihanna Anthony Robledo · Feb. 14, 2023 Topics in this article Rihanna ASAP Rocky Super Bowl Anthony Robledo BuzzFeed News Reporter Anthony Robledo is an entertainment fellow for BuzzFeed News and is based in Los Angeles Contact Anthony Robledo at anthony.robledo@buzzfeed.com .

399,Actress Raquel Welch dies at 82,I,2023-02-15 21:13:56,"WASHINGTON — Raquel Welch, an actress known for her roles in ""One Million Years B.C,"" ""Fantastic Voyage,"" and ""Three Musketeers"" has died. She was 82. The award-winning actress ""passed away peacefully this morning after a brief illness,"" Welch's manager confirmed to People on Wednesday. TMZ first reported the star's death. The 82-year-old had breakout roles in the 1966 sci-films ""Fantastic Voyage"" and ""One Million Years B.C."" Welch had only three speaking lines in the prehistoric fantasy film, but it was her skimpy deerskin bikini that cemented her place as an international sex symbol. ""I just thought it was a goofy dinosaur epic we'd be able to sweep under the carpet one day,"" she told The Associated Press in 1981. ""Wrong. It turned out that I was the Bo Derek of the season, the lady in the loin cloth about whom everyone said, 'My God, what a bod' and they expected to disappear overnight."" Her curves and beauty captured pop culture attention, with Playboy crowning her the ""most desired woman"" of the '70s, despite never being completely naked in the magazine. In 2013, she graced the No. 2 spot on Men's Health's “Hottest Women of All Time” list. In the film “The Shawshank Redemption,” a poster of Welch is used to cover an escape tunnel, the last of three women he used images of after Rita Hayworth and Marilyn Monroe. Welch went on to star in dozens of other movies including ""The Three Musketeers,"" which she won a Golden Globe for. She also appeared in ""The Prince and the Pauper,"" ""Legally Blonde"" and many more. The actress' last film was in the 2017 comedy ""How to Be a Latin Lover,"" starring alongside Salma Hayek, Eugenio Derbez and Rob Lowe. Welch was born Jo-Raquel Tejada in Chicago and raised in La Jolla, California. (The Jo in her name was from her mother, Josephine). Years before her big break, Welch worked as a morning weatherwoman for CBS 8 San Diego. The former Miss La Jolla returned to the station in 2010 and joked her salary at the time was $7.50. ""It was great because it opened up some doors for me, it was an opportunity to be seen by a lot of people,"" Welch explained in 2010. Welch was a divorced mother when she met ex-actor turned press agent, Patrick Curtis. “The irony of it all is that even though people thought of me as a sex symbol, in reality I was a single mother of two small children!” she wrote in her autobiography, “Raquel: Beyond the Cleavage.” Curtis became her manager and second husband and helped shape her into a glamor-girl with hundreds of magazine covers and a string of movies, plus exercise videos and books like ""The Raquel Welch Total Beauty and Fitness Program."" Married and divorced four times, she is survived by two children, Damon Welch and Tahnee Welch, who also became an actress, including landing a featured role in 1985’s “Cocoon.”",entertainment,399

The actor, star of the Netflix streaming hit “You,” doubled down his reasons for wanting less intimate moments with his co-stars in a new interview with Variety , published on Wednesday. “It’s not a place where I’ve blurred lines,” Badgley said of the scenes, “having done a fair amount of them in my career.” “That aspect of Hollywood has always been very disturbing to me — and that aspect of the job, that mercurial boundary — has always been something that I actually don’t want to play with at all,” he continued, adding that it was also “important to me in my real life to not have them.” Advertisement When the interviewer prodded the former “Gossip Girl” star to expand on his “real life” comment, Badgley explained that he meant his “fidelity in my relationship” with his wife, musician and doula Domino Kirke-Badgley. Domino Kirke and Penn Badgley attend a special screening of ""3 Generations"" on April 30, 2017, in New York City. Sylvain Gaboury/Patrick McMullan via Getty Images “My fidelity in my relationship,” Badgley says. “It’s important to me. And actually, it was one of the reasons that I initially wanted to turn the role down. I didn’t tell anybody that. But that is why.” He also told Variety that he is now older than most of his on-screen interests, which “didn’t used to be the case.” Advertisement The entertainer made similar comments about fidelity during Friday’s episode of his podcast, “ Podcrushed .” “Fidelity in my — in every relationship, and especially my marriage — is important to me,” he said on his show. “Yeah, it just got to a point where I don’t want to do [those intimacy scenes].” Badgley and Kirke-Badgley began dating in 2014 and tied the knot in a Brooklyn courthouse three years later. The two share one son together, who they welcomed in 2020. Kirke-Badgley also has a teenage son, Cassius Riley, from a previous relationship.

403,Ellen Barkin Worked On A Number Of Toxic Sets. Then Came 'Poker Face.',I,2023-02-15 21:00:29,"Ellen Barkin was fighting off an illness in bed and about 13 pounds underweight when Rian Johnson offered her an opportunity that would soon become a major highlight of her four-decade career: a part in Peacock’s “Poker Face.” And she had only about three days to prepare. “I actually didn’t know if I had the stamina to do it,” she told me on the phone as she sipped a ginger ale. “And then I just said, ‘No, this is too much fun.’” Advertisement To her point, it is an irresistible role. Her character, similar to many others across the thrilling, “Columbo” like anthology mystery series, is just as juicy as it sounds on paper. In an episode titled “Exit Stage Death,” Barkin plays Kathleen, a “ washed-up ” actor barely keeping afloat a lousy theater production of — well, the actual premise of the play-within-an-episode isn’t really important. On stage, Kathleen dons a fiery red wig, speaks in a much-too-dramatic southern drawl and spouts cheesy lines like “The waves, they won’t meet the clouds” with an impressively straight face. But offstage, Kathleen and scene partner Michael (Tim Meadows), a fellow has-been, are secret lovers who’ve devised a plan to have his filthy rich wife, Ava (Jameela Jamil), fall through a trapdoor to her death so they can collect her money. And they’d have gotten away with it, too, if it weren’t for one pesky waitress cum “human lie detector” (Natasha Lyonne). Barkin takes the stage in a delightfully campy ""Poker Face"" episode titled ""Exit Stage Death."" Sara Shatz/Peacock Advertisement Instead of facing her criminal fate, Kathleen opts to drop down the same trapdoor Ava did, going out just as dramatically as she blew onto the screen. As a big fan of whodunit shows like “Murder, She Wrote,” Barkin jumped at the chance to join “Poker Face,” for which Lyonne also serves as an executive producer . “It was hilariously funny,” she recalled with an almost audible smile. “And there was an enormous amount of room to play with these situations and characters.” Breezy as her episode certainly is, it also portrays heavier truths about ageism, duplicity, capitalism and, for the two main characters, the moral decay of people who refuse to realize that their time is up. “Her exaggeration, her demons — that’s how she’s supposed to act,” Barkin said about Kathleen. “She thinks she’s a star, and she refuses to accept that it’s over.” Though playing a bitter character like this wasn’t exactly a stretch for the actor, who’s also done so in movies like “Breaking News in Yuba County” and “Brooklyn’s Finest” (“I seem to be the go-to mean old lady,” she said), being a part of “Poker Face” for her was simply “pure joy.” Advertisement “It’s fun to be big,” she added. “You’re free, you’re wild and you do crazy things.” Barkin said that being a part of ""Poker Face"" was ""pure joy."" Sara Shatz/Peacock But really, it was the show’s set that proved to be the most gratifying part of the experience. And much of that was due to the environment Lyonne, whom Barkin said she just loves, helped create. “She’s got a shitload of women in these episodes,” Barkin said. “And that’s what I care about.” It’s true. The showrunners, Nora Zuckerman and Lilla Zuckerman, are both women. Aside from Lyonne, who stars in every episode, there are rotating female actors who are prominent throughout the series. And beyond that, Johnson, the series creator and helmer of the “Knives Out” films, and episode director Ben Sinclair were, for Barkin, “the greatest.” “It’s a very safe environment,” she said. “I was never taken care of like this. Never.” That shouldn’t come as a surprise. Hollywood sets have long enabled well-documented abuse over the years. But Barkin is in just one episode of “Poker Face” — an eight- or nine-day shoot, she recalled — and she has had a plethora of starring roles among her film and TV credits. “I’m sorry,” she said when I brought up her IMDB page , apologizing in advance for what she knows it contains. Advertisement Barkin, Leonardo DiCaprio (center) and Robert De Niro on the set of 1993's ""This Boy's Life."" Warner Bros. Pictures/Corbis via Getty Images Part of her dryness about the page is its first few words, which describe her as “offbeat” and “unconventionally pretty,” and it instantly screams sexist. “It’s very misogynistic,” Barkin said. “‘Offbeat’ has to do with — when I first started to make films, my looks took up a large portion of my interviews, negatively. So I was just ripped apart physically in interviews.” You can also find interviews with her in the early ’90s, a decade after her film debut in 1982’s “Diner,” that ogled her appearance and are just as cringey — like this one by The New York Times . “It was like, ‘She looks like she just did eight rounds with Muhammad Ali,’” Barkin recalled. “Who punched her in her eyes? Why are they so small? Who knocked her mouth out of joint?” Advertisement Though she said that her face “has a lot of weirdnesses to it,” she’s proud of the fact that she was still able to make a career for herself. “Then all of a sudden, I wasn’t the overlooked girlfriend or the wife no one wanted,” Barkin continued. “I was the object of desire. And once that happened, then all the good parts went out the window.” And the pigeonholing began. “I was typecast first as the ugly girlfriend,” she said. “And then I went right into the voracious sex symbol, and then I went to mean old lady. So it makes perfect sense — man’s view of me.” Barkin in 1991's ""Switch."" Alamy Stock Photo Added to this misogynistic scrutiny were some of her experiences on various sets, which Barkin remembers in painful detail. “The producer of ‘The Big Easy,’” she said, recalling her 1986 movie. “The director [Jim McBride] was fighting for me for that part, and the producer said in front of me, ‘She looks like a girl who could give you a disease.’” Advertisement Barkin was in her early 30s at the time and had a substantial number of movie credits under her belt. And yet, like many other women in Hollywood then and now, she felt too powerless to react to such behavior. “You do nothing,” she said. “What was I going to do when [director] Harold Becker on ‘Sea of Love’ walks over and literally rips my merkin off, taking some pubic hair with him and saying: ‘What do you need this for? Nobody’s looking at you.’” The actor was referring to shooting a “very difficult” scene in the 1989 neo-noir in which she was completely nude, save for the merkin, and her scene partner was “terrified.” A representative for Becker did not immediately respond to a request for comment. “T his is what [the industry’s] like,” Barkin stated plainly. “And I had an easy time with it, believe me.” “Sea of Love” was 30-plus years ago, long before the #MeToo movement catapulted to the mainstream in 2017, exposing countless allegations of abuse of power behind the scenes. Still, not enough has changed since then. Advertisement Barkin in the fourth season of ""Animal Kingdom"" in 2021. WarnerMedia / The Hollywood Archive Take, for example, Barkin’s time on “Animal Kingdom,” a TNT series adapted from a 2010 Australian movie centering on a criminal family. She played the malicious and utterly captivating matriarch Smurf, one of very few women on the show, from 2016 to 2019 until the character was killed off. “I wanted out,” Barkin said. “They didn’t kill me. I had been asking to leave for four years.” She wanted to step down since day one, even though she was first on the call sheet and the main reason to watch the since-canceled series. And in the beginning, the show wouldn’t let her go. (However, she said it did let co-star Scott Speedman leave when he asked to go. His character was also killed.) For what it’s worth, Barkin said, “That was some of the best work I’ve ever done.” But by her account, “it was not a pleasant place to work.” Smurf became miserably underdeveloped as the seasons progressed, and the show brought on a younger actor to play the part. “Want to talk about treating women disrespectfully? On my show, there’s a young me,” Barkin recalled. “Oh, what is that?” She was already in her 60s when she began “Animal Kingdom” and was shocked by her treatment on set. “My head just whipped around,” Barkin recalled. “I was like, ’What the fuck is going on here?′ Men used to come in my trailer and just scream at me. How’s that? With me pushing them out the door saying, ‘Get out of my trailer.’ That’s what it was like for me to go to work.” Advertisement It was intolerable. “I was like, ‘Wow, I hate these men,’” Barkin said. “Most of them were just like little boys.” Barkin leaves a New York court where she listened in on the rape and sexual assault trial of Harvey Weinstein on Jan. 23, 2020. TIMOTHY A. CLARY via Getty Images If you’ve seen Barkin on social media in recent years, or even read pieces like this one in which she goes off on the rampant toxicity that persists in Hollywood, then you’re probably already familiar with her candor, insight and audacity, which prohibits her from mincing her words. Beyond speaking about her own awful experiences in Hollywood, she’s helped bring attention to world issues and has been unafraid to call out the behavior of those she refers to as “bad-faith actors” — even to the point where she’s been advised against it. “Yeah, I have gotten phone calls that said, ‘Please don’t tweet,’” Barkin said. But that hasn’t stopped her. “The truth is, I am 68 years old,” she said. “I don’t give a fuck. I’m fresh out of all my fucks.” Advertisement And she is just as much beloved for that by her fans as trolls malign her for it. Injustice, against anyone, simply makes her blood boil. “I just can’t watch an underdog or a minority, a woman, a child, a person of color — I can’t see it,” Barkin said. “I go mental. I’m a Jew. I never called myself white. My grandmother taught me that. My bubby said to me: ‘You are not white. Stop saying that.’” Barkin attends an ""Animal Kingdom"" event on April 17, 2016, in New York City. Ilya S. Savenok via Getty Images She still checks the “other” box on her race, even though she believes it was 1940 when white Jewish people no longer had to identify as “other.” But does she recognize that she still benefits from white privilege? “Of course,” she said emphatically. “You kidding me?” She paused, then continued. “As a child, certainly, I had a lot of guilt about it. I was a blond-haired, green-eyed Jew with a little nose when I was young,” she recalled. “It’s called a shiksa — that’s a non-Jewish woman — and I was always referred to that way. So yeah, my privilege, of course.” Advertisement Even the way she was objectified by Hollywood was a result of this privilege. “How many Jewish actresses were considered sex symbols when I came up?” she asked. “Or let’s just say, put in the category of the objective of desire. Two: me and Debra Winger. End of story.” She added, “Two difficult Jews,” referring to Hollywood’s way of defining women who are headstrong or self-possessed. Case in point: when she testified at Johnny Depp and Amber Heard’s defamation trial last year about witnessing violence by Depp, her former lover . She recalled asking why she was subpoenaed and was told that every lawyer in the room said she wouldn’t lie. “And that was the nicest thing anyone ever said,” she remarked. “I felt more proud of myself then. And I was like: ‘That’s the truth. I won’t lie.’” Barkin appears on a screen as a recorded testimony from 2019 is played during the Johnny Depp-Amber Heard defamation trial in Fairfax, Virginia, on May 19. SHAWN THEW/POOL/AFP via Getty Images Advertisement In fact, Barkin considered it her duty. “I’ve never met Amber Heard in my life, but I know what I know about Johnny Depp. He never touched me, but I saw violence. I saw him strangle an AD [assistant director]. He did throw a wine bottle. But I didn’t feel at the time that [testifying] was an act of bravery. I felt it’s just what you do.” Barkin doesn’t claim to be an activist and acknowledged there are certain things she won’t do, such as going to protests, due to her age and fear of violence. So, she focuses on the things she can and feels necessary to do. “I guess I just feel like I’m a human being, and I am obliged to stand up for my fellow man when they need help,” Barkin said. “It sounds corny as shit, but the older I get, the more I just say, ‘This cannot stand with my mouth closed.’” Consider it a piece of power she’s taking back for herself and others. “You want to do this?” she continued. “Go ahead. But I am going to be screaming it from the rooftops.” At this point in her life, Barkin eagerly gravitates toward environments like “Poker Face,” a show that lets her play and be happy in a supportive space for women like her to work. Sure, not every set she’s been on has a bad-faith actor, but too many have. And that makes her experience on the Peacock series especially rewarding. Advertisement Following her experience on ""Poker Face,"" Barkin said she'd love to do more TV. Sara Shatz/Peacock “[It’s] not just that I had a good time and it was fun, but I was so relaxed and safe,” she said. “I haven’t felt that way since doing ‘Ocean’s [Thirteen]’ with my friend George Clooney, because I knew nothing was going to happen to me bad. You just go into the safest environment.” Even if Barkin appears in no other episodes of “Poker Face” (but if you’re reading this, Lyonne and Johnson, she’d like to be invited back), the actor is keen to do more television. “What I really want is just a nice TV show to go to work every day like a person,” she said — t he type of space where she can maybe meet some friends like Jamil and Meadows, the latter of whom she was just texting before our interview. “I like the craft,” Barkin said. “I also like the people. I like meeting a whole new group of people, making friends. And I just like that part of it. I could live without the domineering white, cis, het — whatever the fuck it is. I could deal without all those men.” Related Poker Face Ellen Barkin Go To Homepage Before You Go Candice Frederick Senior Culture Reporter Suggest a correction",entertainment,403

405,Steven Spielberg Doesn’t Regret Turning Down Harry Potter,Anthony Nash,2023-02-15 21:00:00,"Steven Spielberg has no shortage of classic films in his catalog as a director. However, there’s one franchise that the legend actually turned down in order to spend more time with his family. Speaking to fellow director S.S. Rajamouli — who directed the 2022 hit film RRR — Spielberg spoke about just how important spending time with his family is. He likened the pull of art and family to his latest film, The Fabelmans, and described that once he started having children, it was harder to justify leaving everyone to make movies. “The personal meaning about [how the conflict between] art and family will tear you in half happened to me later, after I had already established myself as a filmmaker, as a working director,” said Spielberg. “Kate [Capshaw] and I started raising a family and we started having children, we have seven kids now. But the choice I had to make in taking a job that would move me to another country for four or five months where I wouldn’t see my family every day, that was the art and the family that was really a rending…a ripping kind of experience. ” In a surprising twist, Spielberg also revealed that he even turned down the chance to direct the first Harry Potter film, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone in order to be with his children more. “And there were several films I chose not to make,” Spielberg said. “They offered me Harry Potter. I chose to turn down the first Harry Potter to basically spend that next year and a half with my family, my young kids growing up. So I sacrificed a great franchise, which today looking back I’m very happy to have done, to be with my family. Other times, my family stayed in Los Angeles, and I went abroad to tell a story.” Despite not having the backing of someone like Spielberg, the Harry Potter film franchise went on to do enormously well, grossing more than $7.7 billion in its seven-film history, and becoming the fourth-highest-grossing film series of all time.

413,Why the train wreck in Ohio is such a major public health disaster,Troy Farah,2023-02-15 22:45:02,"-- Shares Facebook Twitter Reddit Email view in app A massive environmental disaster has sent social media into a tailspin for days, following a train derailment in Ohio that leeched toxic chemicals into the ground, water and air. On Feb. 3, a train of about 150 freight cars — many carrying several loads of hazardous materials — crashed and exploded in the town of East Palestine, Ohio. The tangled knot of boxcars operated by Norfolk Southern Railway shot out flames reaching 100 feet and sent a massive plume of coal-black smog into the air that could be seen for miles. Luckily, no direct injuries or deaths were reported. Five days later, crews ignited a controlled burn of the toxic chemicals in order to prevent a much bigger explosion, but the situation appears to be worsening. The local motto for East Palestine, which has a population just shy of 5,000 people, is apparently ""The Place You Want To Be,"" but that sentiment may be less popular right now. Residents and local news agencies have posted viral videos of streams and creeks cluttered with dead fish and frogs, as well as images of the sky darkened with black smoke . Reports have also surfaced that fumes sickened and even killed pets . Related The eerie parallels between Netflix's ""White Noise"" and the Ohio train derailment disaster Many are drawing comparisons to the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster , which turned Pripyat, a city of roughly 50,000 people, into a ghost town. ""We basically nuked a town with chemicals so we could get a railroad open,"" Sil Caggiano, a hazardous materials specialist, told WKBN. On Feb. 6, Gov. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, and Gov. Josh Shapiro, D-Penn., ordered an immediate evacuation in a one-mile by two-mile area surrounding East Palestine, which includes parts of both Ohio and Pennsylvania. Five of the rail cars containing vinyl chloride, a toxic gas, had become unstable, threatening the risk of an explosion that would blast shrapnel and toxic fumes a mile in every direction, according to an analysis by the Ohio National Guard and U.S. Department of Defense. A controlled burn was seen as the best alternative, but anyone who directly breathed in the smog would be risking their lives. ""Based on current weather patterns and the expected flow of the smoke and fumes, anyone who remains in the red affected area is facing grave danger of death,"" DeWine's office warned in a press release. ""Anyone who remains in the yellow impacted area is at a high risk of severe injury, including skin burns and serious lung damage."" A few days later, on Feb. 8, state officials told residents that they could ""safely"" return home, and the air was safe to breathe. However, they encouraged residents not to drink well water. ""Air quality samples in the area of the wreckage and in nearby residential neighborhoods have consistently showed readings at points below safety screening levels for contaminants of concern,"" DeWine's office said in a press release. ""Based on this information, state and local health officials determined that it is now safe for community members to return to their residences."" ""If it's safe and habitable, then why does it hurt? Why does it hurt me to breathe?"" But some locals are distrustful of this advice, concerned by lingering odors of chlorine that are reportedly causing some individuals to experience headaches. ""If it's safe and habitable, then why does it hurt?"" Nathen Velez, a resident of East Palestine, said to CNN. ""Why does it hurt me to breathe?"" ""This is why people don't trust government,"" environmental activist Erin Brockovich tweeted on Feb. 13. ""You cannot tell people that there has been and continues to be hazardous pollutants contaminating the environment while at the same time saying 'all is well.' People aren't stupid."" As more details emerge, the gravity of the situation only seems to worsen. In a letter sent to Norfolk Southern Railway on Feb. 11, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said that in addition to vinyl chloride, four additional toxic chemicals were on board the train: ethylene glycol monobutyl ether, ethylhexyl acrylate, butyl acrylate and isobutylene. While these chemical names may sound like gibberish to most people, experts believe these substances pose critical health risks. Isobutylene, for example, is a flammable gas used to make airtight polymers such as bottle stoppers, O-rings or window seals. If inhaled, isobutylene irritates the lungs ; it can also impact the heart and central nervous system. Then there's ethylhexyl acrylate , a chemical used in paint binding and stain resistors. Inhalation or skin contact with the liquid can cause respiratory tract irritation and irritate the eyes and skin. Butyl acrylate is a colorless liquid with a sharp odor used in paints, caulks, sealants and adhesives. It can trigger difficulties breathing and irritation of the eyes and skin. On Wednesday, the Ohio city of Steubenville detected butyl acrylate in its water intake, though officials said it would be removed from the river using powder activated carbon. Finally, there's ethylene glycol monobutyl ether, sometimes known as 2-butoxyethanol, which is used as a solvent, as well as to make paints and varnish. It can also irritate the eyes and lungs if inhaled, and it has been shown to cause cancer in animals , but data in humans is lacking. The worst of the bunch, however, is seemingly vinyl chloride. Out of the roughly 150 rail cars, of which 50 derailed, five of them contained the stuff, a highly-flammable toxic gas with a faintly sweet odor that is used in the production of plastics like PVC, also known as polyvinyl chloride. (That poly part of the chemical name makes a big difference.) Vinyl chloride is extremely noxious to inhale. Our bodies readily absorb it , causing significant damage to the respiratory and central nervous systems. Want more health and science stories in your inbox? Subscribe to Salon's weekly newsletter The Vulgar Scientist . As the liver metabolizes vinyl chloride, it spits out a chemical called chloroethylene oxide, which subsequently binds to our DNA, essentially vandalizing it and increasing the risk of tumor formation. As such, massive exposure to vinyl chloride is associated with a host of lung, liver, brain and blood cancers. But when the vinyl chloride was burned, the chemical reaction generates new corrosive chemicals : phosgene gas and hydrogen chloride. The first, which has a history of being used in chemical warfare during World War I, can cause coughing, blurred vision, difficulty breathing, nausea, vomiting and death. The severity of symptoms depends on the level of exposure, but phosgene has also been linked to low blood pressure, heart failure and coughing up white to pink-tinged fluid, which is a sign of pulmonary edema, or fluid buildup in the lungs. As for hydrogen chloride, the compound is normally stable , but at high temperatures, it bonds to water molecules easily. This creates hydrochloric acid, which is highly corrosive. When it falls from the sky, it creates acid rain , which is known to kill trees and wildlife . While some of these chemicals will quickly fade from the environment, according to officials, others may linger. As of Tuesday, Feb. 14, the EPA said it had screened 459 homes, with 39 remaining to be screened. ""To date, no detections of vinyl chloride or hydrogen chloride were identified for the completed screened homes,"" the EPA said in a statement. Salon has reached out to the EPA and will update this article if a response is received. The EPA and other agencies are actively monitoring water for contaminants. So far, the derailment is reportedly far enough away from watersheds and local water supplies that it doesn't pose a risk to residents. Nonetheless, the Ohio Farm Bureau Federation has urged members to get the water from their local wells tested as soon as possible. Given that an estimated 100,000 gallons of vinyl chloride was released into the environment, it's perhaps understandable that some residents are wary of such reassurances. Some residents have vowed to seek independent testing while a flurry of lawsuits are brewing. No one should have to undertake complex chemistry lessons to figure out if their home is safe or not. No one should have to undertake complex chemistry lessons to figure out if their home is safe or not. Despite the comparisons to nuclear disasters, the East Palestine train derailment has more in common with a 2012 train derailment in Gloucester County, N.J. Similar to the current incident, a train derailed after hitting a collapsed bridge and released 23,000 gallons of vinyl chloride that wafted into nearby Paulsboro, prompting evacuations. Some, including DeWine, have questioned if these derailments are preventable with better regulation. At a Tuesday press conference, DeWine mentioned Norfolk Southern was not legally required to alert Ohioans regarding the toxic cargo. ""Frankly, if this is true — and I'm told it's true — this is absurd,"" DeWine said . ""Congress needs to take a look at how these things are handled."" In fact, industry lobbyists have invested considerable effort into blocking reforms. Railroad Workers United, a cross-union rail workers' reform group, told The New Republic that the cause of the wreck ""appears to have been a 19th-century style mechanical failure of the axle on one of the cars — an overheated bearing — leading to derailment and then jackknifing tumbling cars."" This mechanical failure could have been averted with better equipment, but reforms have been blocked. In 2017, rail industry donors shoveled more than $6 million in funds to Republican campaigns, including the Trump administration, which later rescinded rules related to train braking systems, according to The Lever. If the train had brakes from this century, this disaster could potentially have been avoided, but Norfolk Southern's ""lobby group nonetheless pressed for the rule's repeal, telling regulators that it would ""impose tremendous costs without providing offsetting safety benefits,"" the Lever reported. Norfolk Southern responded to Salon's request for comment by referring to a pair of press releases detailing community assistance efforts , such as establishing a $1 million fund to support East Palestine community. Until more data becomes available, it's difficult to say exactly how damaging and far-reaching the effects of this disaster will be. Given the scale of the problem and the risks involved, the public is right to demand answers. Clearly, the railroad industry could use more oversight to update trains from obsolete Civil War-era technology. Only time will tell whether the comparisons to Chernobyl or nuclear bombs are accurate, but updating our transportation industry is something that could help us all breathe a little easier.

415,"In California, Democrats Propose $25 Minimum Wage for Health Workers",I,2023-02-15 21:56:24,"Union-aligned Democrats were set to introduce legislation Wednesday mandating a statewide $25 minimum wage for health workers and support staffers, likely setting up a pitched battle with hospitals, nursing homes, and dialysis clinics. State Sen. María Elena Durazo’s bill would require health facilities and home health agencies to give raises to many support employees, including nurse technicians, housekeepers, security guards, food workers, and laundry providers. The Los Angeles Democrat said workers remain underpaid even as they have played a crucial role in the covid-19 pandemic. Now, she argued, many who earn close to the state’s $15.50 minimum wage struggle with inflation. “How do people survive?” Durazo told KHN ahead of the bill’s introduction. “They can’t be on the edge of becoming homeless. That’s what we’re facing.” While the bill is backed by the influential Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West, which represents roughly 100,000 workers statewide, similar proposals have previously faced strong opposition from the health industry. If lawmakers approve the bill and Gov. Gavin Newsom signs it, one labor leader estimated 1.5 million California workers could get a wage hike come January 2024. Last year, the union spent about $11 million to promote local $25 minimum wage measures in 10 Southern California cities while hospitals and health care facilities spent $12 million against them. That fight yielded an opposite decision in November in two cities where the measure made the ballot: Inglewood voters approved raises at private hospitals and dialysis clinics, while voters in Duarte rejected the wage hike. During the campaign, a ballot issue committee with funding from Kaiser Permanente of Northern California, Adventist Health, Cedars-Sinai, Dignity Health, and other hospitals and health systems warned that a $25 minimum wage would raise their costs. Earlier this month, the California Hospital Association launched a campaign to ask lawmakers for an extra $1.5 billion in the state budget for Medi-Cal, the state’s insurance program for people with low incomes and disabilities. In a Feb. 9 memo, Carmela Coyle, the association’s president and CEO, wrote that hospitals need urgent financial relief, citing inflation and mounting costs: “Help is needed — immediately.” Meanwhile, the nursing home industry has said it wants to pay workers more but can’t because the state reimburses them too little for patients enrolled in Medi-Cal. And the dialysis industry has shelled out more than $300 million over the past six years to defeat three statewide ballot measures sponsored by SEIU-UHW to increase staffing at clinics. Negotiations for a statewide $25 minimum wage collapsed in the legislature last summer, in part because union leaders and the hospital association had tied the raise to a delay in costly earthquake upgrades at hospitals. The deal was scuttled by the California Nurses Association, the California Teamsters Public Affairs Council, and other unions concerned about their workers’ safety. The California Dialysis Council also opposed it. Durazo said she’s willing to hear hospitals’ concerns about loosening seismic retrofit standards but prefers to treat the two issues separately. The state has also recognized the need to attract and retain workers by setting aside roughly $1 billion to help the industry address workforce shortages. But labor leaders say workers need a financial incentive. “We have a workforce that has just been through the wringer in the last three years,” said Dave Regan, president of SEIU-UHW. “And lots of health care workers decided, you know, this is just too difficult. It’s too exhausting. It’s too dangerous.” Raising the minimum wage would bring families out of poverty, said Joanne Spetz, director of the Institute for Health Policy Studies at the University of California-San Francisco. But whether the bill will solve chronic workforce shortages is unclear because wages are just one factor. Costlier employees could have negative consequences for health care facilities. “If you don’t get higher reimbursements from Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurers, then you’re gonna have to figure out how to absorb that cost increase,” Spetz said. “Or you just get rid of the worker.” Since Inglewood passed its measure, the wage hike has transformed Byron Vasquer’s life, giving him more time with his family. A distribution technician at Centinela Hospital Medical Center, Vasquer earned $21.17 an hour restocking supplies on every floor. But he said that he needed to take additional work to support his wife and daughter — and that he often missed family celebrations. “Before the increase, I was working two or three jobs to make ends meet,” said Vasquer, who until recently worked weekend shifts at a residential care center in Beverly Hills and drove for Uber. “It was not fun because there’s really no time off.” KHN (Kaiser Health News) is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues.

416,New Childhood Obesity Guidance Raises Worries Over The Risk Of Eating Disorders,I,2023-02-15 21:05:19,"Eating disorder treatment specialists are sounding the alarm over new guidance from the American Academy of Pediatrics advising doctors to treat obesity earlier and more aggressively, which they say could lead to eating disorders. They say it focuses on weight loss and BMI rather than health, minimizes the risk of disordered eating and could perpetuate deep-rooted, damaging stigmas. ""We run the risk of doing significant harm to kids who are 6 or 8 by telling them that they have a disease"" — obesity — ""simply based on their weight status,"" says Dr. Kim Dennis, a certified eating disorder specialist and co-founder of SunCloud Health, a treatment center for eating disorders and other mental health issues. Eating disorders among children and adolescents rose dramatically during the pandemic, and the risk of developing an eating disorder is higher among patients who've been diagnosed as overweight or obese and patients who've engaged in dieting. But supporters say the updated guidance will help destigmatize obesity precisely because it treats it as a disease – like cancer or COVID – that requires medical intervention and isn't the patient's fault. Supervised obesity treatment programs like the one the AAP recommends ""are associated with lower risk of disordered eating,"" says Dr. Sarah Hampl, an author of the new guidelines and a pediatrician at Children's Mercy Kansas City. That risk rises ""when youth try to do it on their own,"" she says. Americans' average weight has been rising dramatically for years , and so have the diseases linked to extra weight, like heart and liver diseases and diabetes, lending a sense of urgency for the AAP to encourage earlier action to stave off more serious health issues down the road. The primary recommendation in the new guidance is intensive health behavior and lifestyle therapy, which entails coaching on nutrition, exercise and behavioral changes like role modeling by parents. Ideally, patients would receive at least 26 hours of in-person treatment over several months. Supporters of the new guidance acknowledge that it will be a while before this type of intensive therapy is widely available, though there currently are other, more accessible alternatives, Hampl says. As well, many people's insurance won't cover it, and it's a significant time commitment. These barriers are even higher for racially and socioeconomically disadvantaged families . In addition to therapy, the AAP now says doctors should offer weight loss drugs to adolescents diagnosed with obesity at age 12 or older and should evaluate teens who are 13 and older with severe obesity for bariatric surgery. Severe obesity is defined as a BMI of 120% of the 95th percentile , or roughly the 99th percentile, for age and sex. Though its use has come under fire , the BMI percentile remains ""the most recognized indicator to diagnose obesity"" and prompts other evaluations to determine treatment, Hampl says. Several eating disorder treatment and advocacy organizations have released statements opposing the guidelines and urging the AAP to reconsider or revise them. Many eating disorder specialists don't believe that obesity should be classified as a disease in the first place because it puts an explicit and misguided focus on weight rather than health. That opens the door to reinforcing weight stigma and preventing patients from receiving proper care . While a person's BMI can tell doctors what risks a patient is more likely to have, ""that's a different matter altogether than saying, 'This is your BMI. You have a disease,'"" says Dennis, the eating disorder specialist. Medical schools generally provide little training on how to identify and treat eating disorders , meaning pediatricians may not be able to identify an eating disorder until it's advanced — especially in larger patients, Dennis says. Heavier patients who've lost a potentially dangerous amount of weight go to a pediatrician, Dennis says, and ""they're told, 'Amazing. Whatever you're doing, keep doing it.'"" Those factors, plus the trauma of weight stigma, make recovery even more challenging for those patients, Dennis and others say. Doctors should treat problems that are linked to unhealthy weight gain and habits, but the focus needs to be on treating specific health issues, not on weight and weight loss, Dennis says. The specialists NPR spoke to were particularly concerned about the new recommendations for weight loss drugs and surgery, given the limited data on the long-term effects of both for children and adolescents and the potential for these treatments to disrupt patients' relationship to food. For instance, when adult patients stop taking the class of weight loss drugs recommended in the guidelines, they often gain the weight back , which means kids might be on the medication for the rest of their lives. They also said there's a risk — thought to be rare, but likely underreported — of disordered eating after bariatric surgery. Monika Ostroff is executive director of the Multi-Service Eating Disorders Association, a treatment and advocacy center, and an eating disorders specialist. She and others have treated patients who developed eating disorders after bariatric surgery, some of whom had the surgery as teenagers. Bariatric surgery ""completely changes the way that you can nourish your body,"" Ostroff says. It dramatically restricts the types and amount of food and drinks patients can have and changes everything down to the speed at which they need to chew. The patients Ostroff treated weren't prepared for those changes, she says, leading to physical complications after surgery and eating disorders down the line. But for children with severe obesity, bariatric surgery is reliably effective and can reverse the condition's life-threatening effects: diabetes, hypertension and liver disease, obesity specialists say. ""The effective treatments for severe obesity in adolescents are really just one: That is bariatric surgery,"" says Dr. Thomas Inge , a director of adolescent bariatric surgery at Children's Hospital Colorado and a lead scientist on a multiyear National Institutes of Health study tracking young bariatric patients . Hampl says the authors of the guidance understand and share concerns about heavier patients' risk of developing eating disorders — which is why the new guidance emphasizes that screening and evaluation for disordered eating should take place not just at the beginning but throughout treatment. The guidelines acknowledge obesity has complex causes outside a person's control, including genetic, environmental and socioeconomic factors. Despite that, patients in larger bodies face harsh, unfair stigma from those — including many doctors — who believe obesity is an individual's choice. Hampl says the AAP has written resources about how to use non-stigmatizing language with patients and is working with external organizations to ensure that guidance reaches pediatricians nationwide. She recommends the University of Connecticut Rudd Center as a good place for doctors and parents alike to find tools to talk about obesity ""in a health-focused, not weight-focused, way."" Some children are diagnosed as overweight or obese and are otherwise healthy, but more often than not, patients have at least one health problem related to their extra weight, ""whether it be medical or psychosocial or emotional,"" Hampl says. Weight loss can help improve those complications, which could otherwise worsen over time. The AAP plans to work with the Academy for Eating Disorders and the National Eating Disorders Association to develop more resources and training on evaluating patients for disordered eating. An AAP clinical report on preventing both obesity and eating disorders is undergoing a scheduled revision , hopefully for release within the next year, and AED and NEDA will serve as reviewing organizations . ""We all care deeply about the well-being of children and adolescents and are eager to work together,"" Hampl said in an email. For now, parents still have to navigate conversations with their kids and make decisions about their health. So what can you do? Experts agree the goal is to make kids healthy, not skinny. Dieting and weight talk — comments about weight and weight loss, no matter who they're directed toward — are associated with higher risk of both obesity and eating disorders, and they can assign moral value to food, so try to avoid them. Small, positive changes — think introducing vegetables and movement that children enjoy — can improve a child's individual health risks regardless of whether there is weight loss, says Dennis of SunCloud Health. Steps like eating meals together as a family can reduce the risk of both eating disorders and obesity. In short: focusing on your child's whole health, including mental health, is the best strategy for trying to avoid serious problems down the road. Being healthy happens ""at a whole range of sizes,"" Dennis says. Copyright 2023 NPR. To see more, visit npr.org .",health,416

420,How dangerous was the Ohio chemical train derailment? An environmental engineer assesses the long-term risks,Andrew J. Whelton,2023-02-15 19:32:20,"Several cars that contained hazardous chemicals burned after the Feb. 3, 2023, derailment. U.S. Environmental Protection AgencyHeadaches and lingering chemical smells from a fiery train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, have left residents worried about their air and water – and misinformation on social media hasn’t helped. State officials offered more details of the cleanup process and a timeline of the environmental disaster during a news conference on Feb. 14, 2023. Nearly a dozen cars carrying chemicals, including vinyl chloride, a carcinogen, derailed on the evening of Feb. 3, and fire from the site sent up acrid black smoke. Officials said they had tested over 400 nearby homes for contamination and were tracking a plume of spilled chemicals that had killed 3,500 fish in streams and reached the Ohio River. However, the slow release of information after the derailment has left many questions unanswered about the risks and longer-term impact. We put five questions about the chemical releases to Andrew Whelton, an environmental engineer who investigates chemical risks during disasters. Let’s start with what was in the train cars. What are the most concerning chemicals for human health and the environment long term, and what’s known so far about the impact? The main concerns now are the contamination of homes, soil and water, primarily from volatile organic compounds and semivolatile organic compounds, known as VOCs and SVOCs. The train had nearly a dozen cars with vinyl chloride and other materials, such as ethylhexyl acrylate and butyl acrylate. These chemicals have varying levels of toxicity and different fates in soil and groundwater. Officials have detected some of those chemicals in the nearby waterway and particulate matter in the air from the fire. But so far, the fate of many of the chemicals is not known. A variety of other materials were also released, but discussion about those chemicals has been limited. State officials disclosed that a plume of contamination released into the nearby creek had made its way into the Ohio River. Other cities get their drinking water from the river, and were warned about the risk. The farther this plume moves downstream, the less concentrated the chemical will be in water, posing less of a risk. Video of the derailment and fire. Long term, the greatest risk is closest to the derailment location. And again, there’s limited information about what chemicals are present – or were created through chemical reactions during the fire. It isn’t clear yet how much went into storm drains, was flushed down the streams or may have settled to the bottom of waterways. There was also a lot of combusted particulate matter. The black smoke is a clear indication. It’s unclear how much was diluted in the air or fell to the ground. How long can these chemicals linger in soil and water, and what’s their potential long-term risk to humans and wildlife? The heavier the chemical, often the slower it degrades and the more likely it is to stick to soil. These compounds can remain for years if left unaddressed. After the Kalamazoo River oil pipeline break in Michigan in 2010, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency excavated a tributary where the oil settled. We’ve also seen from oil spills on the coasts of Alaska and Alabama that oil chemicals can find their way into soil if it isn’t remediated. The long-term impact in Ohio will depend in part on how fast – and thoroughly – cleanup occurs. If the heavily contaminated soils and liquids are excavated and removed, the long-term impacts can be reduced. But the longer removal takes, the farther the contamination can spread. It’s in everyone’s best interest to clean this up as soon as possible and before the region gets rain. Air-stripping devices, like this one used after the derailment, can help separate chemicals from water. U.S. EPA Booms in a nearby stream have been deployed to capture chemicals. Air-stripping devices have been deployed to remove chemicals from the waterways. Air stripping causes the light chemicals to leave the water and enter air. This is a common treatment technique and was used after an 2015 oil spill in the Yellowstone River near Glendive, Montana. At the derailment site in Ohio, workers are already removing contaminated soil as deep as 7 feet (about 2 meters) near where the rail cars burned. Some of the train cars were intentionally drained and the chemicals set on fire to eliminate them. That fire had thick black smoke. What does that tell you about the chemicals and longer-term risks? Incineration is one way we dispose of hazardous chemicals, but incomplete chemical destruction creates a host of byproducts. Chemicals can be destroyed when heated to extremely high temperatures so they burn thoroughly. The black smoke plume you saw on TV was incomplete combustion. A number of other chemicals were created. Officials don’t necessarily know what these were or where they went until they test for them. We know ash can pose health risks, which is why we test inside homes after wildfires where structures burn. This is one reason the state’s health director told residents with private wells near and downwind of the derailment to use bottled water until they can have their wells tested. The EPA has been screening homes near the derailment for indoor air-quality concerns. How do these chemicals get into homes and what happens to them in enclosed spaces? Homes are not airtight, and sometimes dust and other materials get in. It might be through an open door or a window sill. Sometimes people track it in. So far, the U.S. EPA has reported no evidence of high levels of vinyl chloride or hydrogen chloride in the 400 or so homes tested. But full transparency has been lacking. Just because an agency is doing testing doesn’t mean it is testing for what it needs to test for. Media reports talk about four or five chemicals, but the manifest from Norfolk Southern also listed a bunch of other materials in tanks that burned. All those materials create potentially hundreds to thousands of VOCs and SVOCs. Are government officials testing for everything they should? People in the community have reported headaches, which can be caused by VOCs and other chemicals. They’re understandably concerned. Ohio and federal officials need to better communicate what they’re doing, why, and what they plan to do. It’s unclear what questions they are trying to answer. For a disaster this serious, little testing information has been shared. In the absence of this transparency, misinformation is filling that void. From a homeowner’s perspective, it’s hard to understand the true risk if the data is not shared. Andrew J. Whelton receives funding from the U.S. National Science Foundation.

431,"Olaplex hair products caused baldness and blisters, lawsuit alleges",Megan Cerullo,2023-02-15 17:29:00,"Hair care brand Olaplex released the results of tests it says show that its products are safe to use after a group of consumers sued the brand, claiming its products cause hair loss and other injuries. On Wednesday, the company the outcomes of third-party lab tests the company says demonstrate that its products ""do not cause hair loss or hair breakage."" Olaplex hair products went through human repeat insult patch tests (HRIPT), a standard evaluation for personal care products that tests for irritation and sensitization. If a product passes the test, that means it did not cause sensitivity in or inflame the skin or hair follicle, which is what causes hair loss. All Olaplex products passed the test, according to the published results. The data release comes after a group of roughly 30 consumers sued the hair care brand alleging that its products damaged their hair and scalps and left them with bald spots. Olaplex Holdings markets its celebrity-endorsed products as a remedy for dry or damaged hair, claiming its formulas safely ""restore damaged and compromised hair"" and protect against breakage. The plaintiffs allege the Olaplex products do the opposite, leaving their hair ""dry, brittle, frizzy and dull,"" according to the lawsuit, which was filed Thursday in district court in California. One plaintiff said her hair became split and broken, making it look as if it had been cut using a ""weedwhacker."" The plaintiffs also accuse Olaplex of dismissing their concerns and suggesting that hair shedding is either normal or attributable to other causes. Collectively, the plaintiffs are seeking more than $75,000 in damages. Olaplex denies the allegations and defended the safety of their products. ""There are a wide variety of reasons for hair breakage or hair loss, as medical and scientific experts have publicly stated, including lifestyle, various medical conditions and medications, the aftereffects of COVID, skin conditions and more,"" the company said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. ""Complaints like the ones referenced in this article are, sadly, a fact of life in our industry, and have been made against other brands in the category for years,"" Olaplex added. The Food and Drug Administration has received about 25 consumer complaints about Olaplex's products, according to , which cited a public-records request. Shares of Olaplex, which is publicly traded, slumped after news of the suit surfaced.

433,A new post-Roe reality: What will medical abortion look like if Trump judge bans mifepristone pill?,Nicole Karlis,2023-02-15 17:00:01,"-- Shares Facebook Twitter Reddit Email view in app A Trump-appointed federal judge is expected to hand down a decision this month that could block access to mifepristone, one of the two drugs used in the recommended medication abortion regimen. The consequences of such a decision would not only be seen in states with abortion restrictions but in states where abortions still remain legally accessible, too. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved mifepristone for the medical termination of pregnancy over two decades ago. But a lawsuit filed last November alleges that the longstanding approval should be revoked because it was allegedly based on incomplete data. The anti-abortion organization Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine claims that the FDA failed to protect women when it approved the drug. ""The lawsuit alleges that the side effects of mifepristone were not reported adequately 23 years ago when they were reported to the FDA, or that there are more side effects,"" Seema Mohapatra, a professor of law at SMU Dedman School of Law, told Salon. ""That is actually scientifically disputed, there are tons of studies showing how safe and effective mifepristone is."" Related The FDA quietly expands access to medication abortions Indeed, last week, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Medical Association and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, and nine other prominent medical organizations submitted an amicus brief including a list of evidence that shows mifepristone is safe and effective. ""Medication abortion including mifepristone is safe and effective,"" the brief states. ""This is not an opinion—it is a fact based on hundreds of medical studies and vast amounts of data amassed over the course of two decades; the FDA based its initial approval on robust evidence which showed mifepristone was extremely safe."" Medication abortions occur through the brand name drug Mifeprex. In the two-step process, a pregnant person first takes a mifepristone pill, which is the drug at the center of the lawsuit. Either 24 to 48 hours later, a second pill containing misoprostol is taken. Medication abortion works up to 70 days after the first day of a person's last period — usually when they are 10 weeks pregnant. According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , medication abortions account for an estimated 42 percent of all abortions in the United States. Without the mifepristone pill, the first step in the process, the only drug that will be available for medication abortions is misoprostol. Will this still work? The short answer is yes. A misoprostol-only medication abortion, it should be noted, is not FDA-approved, so technically this use is off-label. While mifepristone blocks progesterone, a hormone needed to support pregnancy, misoprostol contracts and dilates the cervix to expel the embryo. Many studies have shown that misoprostol is safe and effective at terminating pregnancy in the first trimester alone. However, some studies have found that the regimen in taking both mifepristone and misoprostol is more effective than taking misoprostol alone. On Feb. 6, University of Texas-Austin researchers published a peer-reviewed study on the use of misoprostol alone for abortion and concluded it was 88% effective. The research was based on data from the telemedicine abortion provider Aid Access. Misoprostol is most commonly sold under the brand name Cytotec. ""Self-managed medication abortion using misoprostol provided by an online telemedicine service has a high rate of effectiveness and a low rate of serious adverse events,"" the authors concluded . ""As mifepristone continues to be over-regulated and the 2022 US Supreme Court ruling allows states to severely restrict access to in-clinic abortion care, this regimen is a promising option for self-managed abortion in the US."" Misoprostol is a widely available medication, and its primary use is to treat gastric ulcers. Women in Brazil in the 1980s saw an opportunity with its warning label, which stated that the drug could cause a miscarriage. ""We've seen in other countries that have had similar ideological issues, like Brazil, where we've seen miso-only abortions be effective,"" Mohapatra said. ""So it was actually developed for gastric ulcers, and then it was an off-label use in terms of using it for abortion."" Mohapatra emphasized this is very common. ""Off-label use of FDA-approved drugs is very common, a lot of times it's the most common way a drug is used,"" Mohapatra said. ""We've seen this in other contexts."" Pro-abortion advocates anticipate it will be easier for clinics in states where abortion care is still accessible to pivot to misoprostol-only abortions instead of in-clinic procedural ones. ""It would be difficult, if not outright impossible, for providers that only offer medication abortion using mifepristone to switch to offering procedural abortions instead,"" Guttmacher Institute said in an updated analysis. ""Some of these providers will pivot to offering medication abortion using only misoprostol, while others will be forced to stop offering abortion services entirely."" Still, a misoprostol-only option isn't ideal. ""While 98% of medication abortions in the United States in 2020 used a regimen of mifepristone and misoprostol in combination, misoprostol can be used on its own to end a pregnancy,"" Guttmacher Institute stated. ""If mifepristone becomes unavailable, it is unclear whether all current providers using the two-drug regimen would offer abortion care using only misoprostol and to what extent patients would take up this method.""

457,"Three years into the pandemic, nursing home residents are still in Covid’s crosshairs",By Krista Mahr,2023-02-15 09:30:00,"A certified nursing assistant at the Hebrew Home at Riverdale receives her COVID-19 booster shot at her workplace in New York, Sept. 27, 2021. Today, just over half of nursing home residents and nearly 23 percent of nursing home staff have received the bivalent booster. | Seth Wenig/AP Photo By Krista Mahr 02/15/2023 04:30 AM EST Link Copied Federal health agencies worked to get more nursing home residents and staff to take the latest Covid booster all winter, creating social media hashtags, putting money into vaccine hotlines and flagging the worst performing facilities to states. But their decision to scale back on two vaccine interventions that were critical in getting residents and staff protected from Covid during the first vaccine rollout in late 2020 and 2021 has left the job mostly to facilities, resident advocates say, with disappointing results. Today, just over half of nursing home residents and nearly 23 percent of nursing home staff have received the bivalent booster , a precipitous drop from the more than 85 percent of residents and staff who received the primary vaccine. That’s still higher than most Americans: A scant 16 percent of the eligible U.S. population has gotten the updated shot. But when it comes to Covid, nursing home residents have never been like most Americans. Nursing home residents make up about one out of every six cumulative Covid deaths in the U.S., according to AARP, and hundreds of residents are still dying each week. By Katherine Ellen Foley Nearly three years since SARS-CoV-2 devastated residents, their families and staff, the Biden administration is struggling to ensure the country’s most vulnerable population is protected from the virus. As the federal government loosens its grip on managing the pandemic in long-term care facilities — as it has throughout society — not all nursing homes are stepping into the breach to encourage residents and staff to get boosted, raising the question of who, in a Covid-endemic America, is ultimately responsible for continuing to protect this uniquely exposed community from an unpredictable disease. “There’s this real disconnect between the idea that we have to be hypervigilant protecting residents, but at the same time the underlying policy isn’t reflecting that,” said Sam Brooks, director of public policy for the National Consumer Voice for Quality Long-Term Care. “It’s kind of back to how things were before. And that’s sad. Because how it was before was why this happened.” The Trump and then Biden administrations’ first nursing home vaccination campaign was a bright spot in the early pandemic response: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention teamed up with CVS and Walgreens to stage free, on-site clinics at thousands of long-term care facilities across the country, ultimately administering some eight million shots. Later, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which monitors the more-than-15,000 nursing homes that receive Medicare and Medicaid dollars, introduced a requirement that those facilities’ staff must get their primary Covid vaccination. The two policies helped push both groups’ Covid vaccination rates far above the nursing home vaccination rates for other diseases, such as flu and pneumococcal. But they weren’t used again for the bivalent shot, which protects against the Covid strain that now comprises the majority of cases. Nursing home residents who are not up to date on their Covid vaccinations are up to 50 percent more likely to be infected than their peers who are, according to the CDC. The CDC still partners with retail pharmacies at tens of thousands of locations around the country to administer vaccines, but has scaled back the program, putting the onus on long-term facilities to arrange most onsite vaccine clinics from pharmacies or state health departments, or administer the vaccine themselves. CMS also has not updated its staff vaccine mandate to include the bivalent shot or previous boosters, despite research showing that higher staff vaccination rates are associated with lower rates of infection and death among residents. “For the initial vaccination campaign in 2021, we saw an extraordinary effort and we got extraordinary results. For delivering Covid boosters to nursing home residents, we saw a normal effort and we got normal results,” said Ari Houser, senior methods advisor at the AARP Public Policy Institute. “I had hoped that the lesson learned from that very successful initial vaccination campaign is that we should do this more often… But it doesn’t seem to have been the way things went.” Everyone agrees that vaccine fatigue among residents and staff alike — as in the rest of the country — is pervasive, but nursing homes are doing an uneven job on their own navigating that challenge, advocates say. Administration health officials, for their part, say they have tried tackling the low booster rate from every angle. Nursing home residents remain the nation’s “most vulnerable” group, CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said on Feb. 8 while testifying before Congress, adding that the current booster vaccination rate “is not enough.” In November, CMS reminded nursing homes that they are required to educate residents and staff about Covid vaccines and to offer to administer boosters. The agency also provided more assistance to facilities to help them set up on-site clinics and distribute vaccine education materials. The agency has sent a list of nursing homes’ vaccination rates to states, and last month CMS Administrator Chiquita Brooks-LaSure wrote to the governors of Arizona, Nevada, Florida, Texas and Mississippi — the five states with the lowest resident booster rates — and requested calls about how to improve the situation. CMS declined to say whether those have taken place. When asked whether CMS considered updating the staff vaccine mandate to include the latest shot, a CMS spokesperson responded that boosters were not recommended at the time the rule was made in late 2021, but that the agency has “continued to encourage all eligible individuals to remain up to date by receiving the latest updated bivalent vaccine.” As for the on-site clinics, when the booster was authorized, officials determined that vaccine demand wasn’t sufficient at this point in the pandemic to flood nursing homes with clinics again, particularly if relatively few residents might get vaccinated at each event. The CDC has instead focused its efforts on teaming up with national organizations trying to combat vaccine fatigue and hesitancy and help long-term care facilities link up with pharmacies, among other measures. Later this month, CDC is scheduled to host a “bootcamp” for long-term care facility administrators and health care providers to help them figure out how to improve vaccine confidence in their facilities. Nursing home representatives say the current system is working as well as can be expected three years into the pandemic. Facilities aren’t having any problem accessing or administering the vaccines, they say, but vaccine fatigue is widespread among residents, family members and the communities where staff live. Residents need to get boosted, but they’re not seeing the same scale of death and illness happening as they were when the first vaccine came out, said David Gifford, chief medical officer of the American Health Care Association and National Center for Assisted Living, which represents over 14,000 nursing homes and assisted living communities. “It’s a demand problem. You can send out the National Guard to every nursing home. You’re not going to see the vaccine go up,” he said. “How much do we want to badger the elderly to get the vaccine? That’s what it comes down to. Some people may not be badgering them as hard as other people.” Arizona, which has the lowest resident booster rate in the nation at 35 percent, was one of the states to get a letter from Brooks-LaSure. “It comes down to the leadership of the facilities believing in the vaccine,” said David Voepel, CEO of the Arizona Health Care Association, a member association for nursing homes in the state. “Once you have that leadership buy-in and that education moving throughout the facility, then it spreads like wildfire — either positive or negative.” Voepel said that expanding the CMS staffing mandate to include the booster would probably not sit well in Arizona, a sentiment shared broadly in an industry that worries another requirement would make it even harder to recruit and retain workers amid a long-running staffing crisis. As for having more free, on-site clinics come to facilities, Voepel said the federal government probably should have “done more on that end, but hindsight is 20-20.” The Big Idea By Alexandra Moe The Arizona Department of Health Services is worried about the steep drop between the primary vaccine numbers and booster numbers in older adults, spokesperson Steve Elliott said in a statement to POLITICO. “The results have been far different from the earliest phase of the COVID-19 vaccination response, when Arizona’s long-term care facilities had success getting residents the primary series of COVID-19 vaccinations through the CDC’s partnership with Walgreens and CVS,” he wrote. “Uptake of the bivalent booster is lower than everyone wishes among all Arizonans ages 65 and older.” The state has set up a mobile vaccination program that visits individuals in their homes and at facilities, he said. But so far, since the bivalent booster was rolled out, that service has only visited about 30 of the state’s 155 licensed long-term care facilities as of the end of last year, he said. “Facilities struggle to attract and retain employees, and they have faced an early surge in influenza and RSV, in addition to COVID-19 remaining active in communities,” Elliott said. “Some facilities have told us that arranging for and holding a mobile clinic is difficult for already taxed employees.” Older Arizonans still have a lot of questions about the vaccine, including confusion over why the bivalent shot is different from the boosters that came before it, said Voepel. Both the state and federal education campaigns are underway, he said, but there are still a lot of things they have “to work through.” Answering those questions — and battling vaccine misinformation and fatigue — has been a central plank of the federal effort to get more older Americans boosted this fall and winter. Late last year, HHS ran ads about the updated vaccine aimed at older adults in several underserved communities. The CDC ran pre-Thanksgiving and holiday campaigns to reach older adults and long-term care facilities, both by sending out flyers to distribute in facilities and through social media. But observers say those campaigns, however well intentioned, simply have not landed in a sprawling network of facilities where resident and staff attitudes toward the Covid vaccines are influenced by everything from the homes’ leadership to staffing numbers to local politics. “If you’re going to move the needle, it’s going to take a lot more than education,” said David Grabowski, a professor of health care policy at Harvard Medical School who studies the nursing home industry. He said he was “skeptical” about the administration’s decision to focus on education in nursing homes when it came to the booster, given that recent research has shown its impact to be limited on both nursing home staff and on resident vaccination rates. “I would say put those dollars towards clinics, or something that has been shown to work,” he said. America’s nursing homes have been at the epicenter of the pandemic since its earliest days, when the nation watched as cases of a new virus spread rapidly through a nursing home in Washington State. That nursing home received a fine of hundreds of thousands of dollars for violating infection control regulations, one of the quality of care standards that CMS measures in nursing homes that receive federal money. That was rare. An analysis published in May 2020 by the Government Accountability Office found that between 2013 and 2017, more than 80 percent of U.S. nursing homes had at least one infection prevention and control violation, and half of those had multiple violations. The state surveyors who conducted the evaluations classified almost every one of the violations as “not severe” — meaning they believed no residents were harmed — and only about 1 percent of the violations resulted in any enforcement action by CMS, like having to pay a fine. A year ago, the Biden administration laid out an ambitious plan to make nursing homes safer and more transparent, noting that the hundreds of thousands of Covid deaths among residents and staff “highlighted the tragic impact of substandard conditions at nursing homes.” By Krista Mahr and Daniel Payne But the pandemic, while raising awareness of the need for better infection prevention and control in nursing homes, did not necessarily change how some violations of best practices were evaluated and regulated. In 2021 and 2022, during the height of the pandemic, inspectors reported that the vast majority of infection prevention and control violations they found caused “no actual harm,” according to a CMS database . That level of citation typically requires a facility to create a “plan of correction,” but it is extremely rare for a facility to face any financial penalty, says Brooks of the National Consumer Voice for Quality Long-Term Care. When asked whether CMS considered changes to how it regulates infection control after the 2020 GAO report, a CMS spokesperson, in a written response, told POLITICO: “Regardless of whether there is a penalty or not, nursing homes are required to correct their noncompliance in order to continue to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Plans of correction are a critical tool in this process and play a large role, prior to fines being accessed for continued non-compliance.” This winter, as Covid cases began to ramp back up, CMS reminded long term care facilities about the importance of infection control, and the White House issued a “winter playbook,” urging facilities to once again try to improve booster rates, test symptomatic residents and staff, make sure treatment options were available and improve indoor air quality. But without stronger enforcement — and in particular, financial consequences — the industry doesn’t correct itself, said Toby Edelman, a senior policy attorney at the Center for Medicare Advocacy. “Nothing really has changed. We still have the same deficiencies now,” said Edelman. “It’s very disheartening because this is life and death for so many people.”",health,457

460,Can love improve your health? It may depend on the type of love you're experiencing,Jeff Wagner,2023-02-15 04:10:00,"Love for your partner, family, even friends is celebrated on Valentine's Day. We know the warm feeling can bring us no matter the time of year. But what if there's more to that feeling? How can love improve your health? Good Question. Jeff Wagner learned its power, from your heart to your mind. How does the feeling of love impact the heart? It depends on what type of love you're experiencing, said Dr. Michelle Carlson, a cardiologist with Hennepin Healthcare. ""If it's new love, it's exciting. We're going to have hormones released in our body, hormones like epinephrine, norepinephrine,"" said Dr. Carlson. Those hormones raise your blood pressure and heart rate, which is good for the heart in short bursts. ""Lets say it's love that's been there for a while, love that has some calmness with it, whether that's love for a partner or your dog or your friend, that's going to bring release of oxytocin,"" said Dr. Carlson. Oxytocin will lower your blood pressure and help calm your nervous system. There are reports that people who are married live longer. How does lasting love impact the heart? The first way is again through oxytocin, helping lower someone's blood pressure across their lifespan. The second is the support system that comes through having a loved one over the years. ""Someone who will remind you to take your medications. Someone who will help your mental health so that you'll be more willing and able to take care of yourself for the long term,"" said Dr. Carlson. Improving the health of the heart is only part of love's power. Another area it can help out is our mental health. What are the benefits of having love for our brain? ""When people are socially supported, valued, connected, and respected by others, this results in a sense of belonging and security, and this can actually reduce the impact of stress,"" said Dr. Kaz Nelson, associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the University of Minnesota Medical School. ""Whereas we know high stress is a risk factor for many mental illnesses, including illnesses related to anxiety and depression disorders."" The mental health benefit could come from a group, such as your family, or a significant other. Love releases several hormones in the brain. Some, like dopamine, cause euphoria. Others, like oxytocin and vasopressin, lead to calmness, security, and attachment, which can be vital in maintaining long-term relationships. ""[Love is] one of the core pleasurable activities that humans can engage in,"" said Dr. Nelson.

461,"After three transplants, Minneapolis mom is encouraging more people to register as organ donors",David Schuman,2023-02-15 03:49:00,"– Tuesday was not only Valentine's Day, but also National Donor Day. Melanie Wickersheim, a Minneapolis mother who's undergone two heart transplants, has made it her mission to share how life-changing organ donations can be. Wickersheim needed a heart last year, nearly three decades after her first transplant. ""I was 10 years old when I was diagnosed with myocarditis,"" Wickersheim said. ""I just became very sick, very suddenly. I was very close to dying at that point."" But a match came through. Wickersheim says she went on to do everything a person could imagine in life, including finding love and having a daughter. ""That dream kind of came to a halt in 2020 when I had a heart attack,"" she said. Wickersheim had transplant coronary artery disease. The only treatment was another transplant. She waited two months for a donor match. ""I would wake up everyday thinking, 'Is this the day that I'm going to get the call, or is this the day that my heart's going to give out?'"" Wickersheim said. The new heart came thanks in part to new technology that keeps the donor heart beating, adding hours to the amount of time it can be in transit. ""It's a huge game-changer,"" said Erin Hannibal, the heart transplant coordinator at Abbott Northwestern Hospital. ""It allows us to open the pool of donors that we're looking at for our recipients, essentially casting a wider net."" Wickersheim says she honors her donor by being as healthy as she can be. She has profound gratefulness for her gift. ""Registering to be an organ donor is an act of love,"" Wickersheim said. ""Being generous in this way is just so powerful."" Wickersheim also needed a kidney last year, which she received from the same donor on the same day as her heart. More than 100,000 people are on the transplant waiting list, and there aren't enough donors for all of them. Become a donor at .
